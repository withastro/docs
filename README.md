Want to share an idea with us?

Discussions are threads where you can offer feedback on things that might not exactly be problems to be fixed but are ideas to be explored.

## Make a Fix or Contribution

Did you find a typo, a broken link, or another item with an obvious quick fix?

If you can see what the problem is, and you know how to fix it, then you can make a PR (pull request) with the change and contribute to the docs repo yourself.
