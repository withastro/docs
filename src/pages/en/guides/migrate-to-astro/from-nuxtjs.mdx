Here are some key concepts and migration strategies to help you get started. Use the rest of our docs and our [Discord community](https://astro.build/chat) to keep going!

## Key Similarities between Nuxt and Astro

Nuxt and Astro share some similarities that will help you migrate your project:

- Astro projects can also be SSG or [SSR with page level prerendering](/en/guides/server-side-rendering/#prerendering).
- Astro uses file-based routing, and [allows specially named pages to create dynamic routes](/en/core-concepts/routing/#dynamic-routes).
- Astro is [component-based](/en/core-concepts/components/), and your markup structure will be similar before and after your migration.
- Astro has [an official integration for using Vue components](/en/guides/integrations-guide/vue/).
- Astro has support for [installing NPM packages](/en/guides/imports/#npm-packages), including Vue libraries. You may be able to keep some or all of your existing Vue components and dependencies.

## Key Differences between Nuxt and Astro

When you rebuild your Nuxt site in Astro, you will notice some important differences:

- [MPA vs SPA](/en/concepts/mpa-vs-spa/): Nuxt is a Vue-based SPA (single-page application). Astro sites are multi-page apps built using `.astro` components, but can also support React, Preact, Vue.js, Svelte, SolidJS, AlpineJS, Lit and raw HTML templating.

- [Page Routing](/en/core-concepts/astro-pages/#file-based-routing): Nuxt uses `vue-router` for SPA routing, and `vue-meta` for managing `<head>`. In Astro, you will create separate HTML page routes and control your page `<head>` directly, or in a layout component.

- [Content-focus](/en/concepts/why-astro/): Astro was designed primarily for content-focused sites. While Nuxt has the capability to do content-focused sites through `@nuxt/content`, it's primarily geared towards interactive websites. This differs from Astro, which has built-in capabilities for content page generation, but may be difficult to replicate interactive components such as dashboards within.

## Convert your NuxtJS Project

Each project migration will look different. But, there are some common steps you will probably need to get your new Astro site up and running.

Even after following these instructions, you probably won't have your new Astro site exactly the way you want it yet. But, this page will get you started in the right direction.

### Create a new Astro project
Use the `create astro` command for your package manager to launch Astro's CLI wizard or choose a community theme from the [Astro Theme Showcase](https://astro.build/themes).


You can also pass a `--template` argument to the `create astro` command to start from an existing Astro repository on GitHub:

  <PackageManagerTabs>
    <Fragment slot="npm">
    ```shell
    # launch the Astro CLI Wizard 
    npm create astro@latest

    # start from any existing repo
    npm create astro -- --template <github-username>/<github-repo>
    ```
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="pnpm">
    ```shell
    # launch the Astro CLI Wizard 
    pnpm create astro@latest

    # start from any existing repo
    pnpm create astro --template <github-username>/<github-repo>
    ```
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="yarn">
    ```shell
    # launch the Astro CLI Wizard 
    yarn create astro@latest

    # start from any existing repo
    yarn create astro --template <github-username>/<github-repo>
    ```
    </Fragment>
  </PackageManagerTabs>

Then, copy your existing Nuxt project files over to your new Astro project in a separate folder outside of `src`.

### Install integrations (optional)

You may find it useful to install some of [Astro's optional integrations](/en/guides/integrations-guide/) to use while converting your Nuxt project to Astro:

- **@astrojs/vue**: to reuse some existing Vue UI components in your new Astro site, or keep writing with Vue components.

- **@astrojs/image**: to replace Nuxt's Image plugin with Astro's own image-optimizing components.

- **@astrojs/mdx**: to bring existing MDX files from your Nuxt project, or to use MDX in your new Astro site.

### Put your source code in `src`

1. **Move** Nuxt's `static/` folder to `public/`. 
   
    Astro uses the `public/` directory for static assets, similar to Nuxt's `static/` folder.

2. **Copy or Move** Nuxt's other files and folders (e.g. `pages`, `layouts` etc.) into Astro's `src/` folder.

    Like Nuxt, Astro's `src/pages/` folder is a special folder used for file-based routing. All other folders are optional, and you can organize the contents of your `src/` folder any way you like. Other common folders in Astro projects include `src/layouts/`, `src/components`, `src/styles`, `src/scripts`.


### Repurpose config file

Astro has a configuration file at the root of your project called [`astro.config.mjs`](/en/guides/configuring-astro/). This is used only for configuring your Astro project and any installed integrations, including [SSR adapters](/en/guides/deploy/).

### Convert Vue SFC files to `.astro` files

Here are some tips for converting a Nuxt `.vue` component into a `.astro` component:

1. Use the `<template>` of the existing NuxtJS component function as the basis for your HTML template.

2. Change any [Nuxt or Vue syntax to Astro](#convert-nuxtjs-syntax-to-astro) or to HTML web standards. This includes `<NextLink>`, `:class`, `{{variable}}`, and `v-if`, for example.

1. Move `<script>` JavaScript, into a "code fence" (`---`).

4. Write an `Astro.props` statement to access any additional props that were previously passed to your Vue component.

4. Decide whether any imported components also need to be converted to Astro. With the official integration installed, you can [use existing Vue components in your Astro file](/en/guides/integrations-guide/react/). But, you may want to convert them to Astro, especially if they do not need to be interactive!

See [an example from a Nuxt app converted step-by-step](#examples-from-nuxtjs).

#### Compare: Vue vs Astro

Compare the following Nuxt component and a corresponding Astro component:

<AstroVueTabs>
  <Fragment slot="vue">
    ```vue title="Page.vue"
    <template>
      <div>
        <p v-if="message === 'Not found'">
          The repository you're looking up doesn't exist
        </p>
        <div v-else>
          <Header/>
          <p class="banner">Astro has {{stars}} 🧑‍🚀</p>
          <Footer />
        </div>
      </div>
    </template>

    <script>
    import Vue from 'vue'
    
    export default Vue.extend({
      name: 'IndexPage',
      async asyncData() {
        const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/withastro/astro')
        const json = await res.json();
        return {
          message: json.message,
          stars: json.stargazers_count || 0,
        };
      }
    });
    </script>
    
    <style scoped>
    .banner {
      background-color: #f4f4f4;
      padding: 1em 1.5em;
      text-align: center;
      margin-bottom: 1em;
    }
    <style>
    ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="astro">
    ```astro title="Page.astro"
    ---
    import Header from "./header";
    import Footer from './footer';
    import "./layout.css";

    const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/withastro/astro')
    const json = await res.json()
    const message = json.message;
    const stars = json.stargazers_count || 0;
    ---
    
    {message === "Not Found" ? 
          <p>The repository you're looking up doesn't exist</p> :
          <>
                <Header />
                <p class="banner">Astro has {stars} 🧑‍🚀</p>
                <Footer />
            </> 
    }
    
    <style>
      .banner {
        background-color: #f4f4f4; 
        padding: 1em 1.5em;
        text-align: center;
        margin-bottom: 1em;
      }
    <style>
    ```
  </Fragment>
</AstroVueTabs>

### Migrating Layout Files

You may find it helpful to start by converting your Nuxt layouts and templates into [Astro layout components](/en/core-concepts/layouts/).

Each Astro page explicitly requires `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags to be present, so it is common to reuse a layout file across pages. Your Nuxt `layout.vue` and templates will not include these.

Note the standard HTML templating, and direct access to `<head>`:  

```astro title="src/layouts/Layout.astro"
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>Astro</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Wrap the slot element with your existing layout templating -->
    <slot />
  </body>
</html>
```

You may also wish to reuse code from [your Nuxt's page's `head` property](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/configuration-glossary/configuration-head/#the-head-property) to include additional site meta data. Notice that Astro uses neither `vue-meta` nor a component's `head` property creates `<head>` directly. You may import and use components, even within `<head>`, to separate and organize your page content.

### Migrating Pages and Posts

In NuxtJS, your [pages](/en/core-concepts/pages/) live in `/pages`. In Astro, **all your page content must live within `src/`**.

#### Vue Pages

Your existing Nuxt Vue (`.vue`) pages will need to be [converted from Vue files to `.astro` pages](#convert-vue-files-to-astro-files). You cannot use an existing Vue page file in Astro.

These [`.astro` pages](/en/core-concepts/pages/) must be located within `src/pages/` and will have page routes generated automatically based on their file path.

##### Dynamic File Path Naming

{/* Change _name.vue to [name].astro */}



#### Markdown and MDX pages

Astro has built-in support for Markdown and an optional integration for MDX files. You can reuse any existing Markdown and MDX pages, but they may require some adjustments to their frontmatter, such as adding [Astro's special `layout` frontmatter property](/en/core-concepts/layouts/#markdownmdx-layouts). You will no longer need to manually create pages for each Markdown-generated route or use an external package like `@nuxt/content`. These files can be placed within `src/pages/` to take advantage of automatic file-based routing.

When part of a [content collection](/en/guides/content-collections/), Markdown and MDX files will live in folders within `src/content/` and you will [generate those pages dynamically](/en/guides/content-collections/#generating-pages-from-content-collections).

### Migrating Tests

As Astro outputs raw HTML, it is possible to write end-to-end tests using the output of the build step. Any end-to-end tests written previously might work out-of-the-box, if you have been able to match the markup of your Nuxt site. Testing libraries such as Jest and Vue Testing Library can be imported and used in Astro to test your Vue components.

See Astro's [testing guide](/en/guides/testing/) for more.

## Reference: Convert NuxtJS Syntax to Astro

### Nuxt Variable Interpolation to Astro

A Nuxt Vue component might have the following to display a variable within a paragraph tag:

```vue title="components/Component.vue"
<p>{{message}}</p>
```

To interpolate a variable in an Astro component, change the set of two curly braces to one set of curly braces:

```astro title="src/components/Component.astro"
<p>{message}</p>
```

### Nuxt Property Passing to Astro


To bind a property to an attribute or component in Vue, you'd do the following:

```vue title="components/Component.vue"
<p v-bind:aria-label="message">...</p>
<!-- Or -->
<p :aria-label="message">...</p>
<!-- Also support component props -->
<Header title="Page"/>
```

To bind an attribute or component property in an Astro component, change this syntax to the following:

```astro title="src/components/Component.astro"
<p aria-label={message}>...</p>
<!-- Also support component props -->
<Header title={"Page"}/>
```

### Nuxt Links to Astro

Convert any Nuxt `<NuxtLink to="">`components to HTML `<a href="">` tags. 

```astro del={1} ins={2}
<NuxtLink to="/blog">Blog</Link>
<a href="/blog">Blog</a>
```

Astro does not use any special component for links, although you are welcome to build custom link components. You can then import and use this `<Link>` just as you would any other component.

```astro title="src/components/Link.astro"
---
const { to } = Astro.props
---
<a href={to}><slot /></a>
```

### Nuxt Imports to Astro

If necesssary, update any file imports to reference relative file paths exactly. This can be done using [import aliases](/en/guides/typescript/#import-aliases), or by writing out a relative path in full.

Note that `.astro` and several other file types must be imported with their full file extension.

```astro title="src/pages/authors/Fred.astro" ".astro"
---
import Card from `../../components/Card.astro`;
---
<Card />
```

### Nuxt Dynamic Page Generation to Astro

In Nuxt, to generate a dynamic page you either must:

- Use SSR
- [Use the `generate` function in `nuxt.config.js` to define all possible static routes](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/configuration-glossary/configuration-generate/)

In Astro, you must export a `getStaticPaths` function to tell the framework which routes it is expected to generate for a dynamic page.

Assuming you have a Nuxt page called `/pages/pokemon/_name.vue` that you want to generate for each Pokémon, you would have the following function in your `nuxt.config.js`:

```javascript title="nuxt.config.js"
{
	// ...
    generate: {
        async routes() {
          // Axios is required here unless you're using Node 18
          const res = await axios.get("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=151")
          const pokemons = res.data.results;

          return pokemons.map(pokemon => {
            return '/pokemon/' + pokemon.name
          })
        }
      }
}
```

This is replaced in Astro with a function that's located within the code block of your page itself:

```astro title="src/pages/pokemon/[name].astro"
---
export const getStaticPaths = async () => {
  const res = await fetch("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=151")
  const resJson = await res.json();
  const pokemons = resJson.results;
  return pokemons.map(({ name }) => ({
      params: { name },
    }))
}

// ...
---

<!-- Your template here -->
```

### Nuxt Data Fetching to Astro

Nuxt has two methods of fetching server-side data:

- [`asyncData` options API](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/features/data-fetching/#async-data)
- [`fetch` hook](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/features/data-fetching/#the-fetch-hook)

Astro simplifies this to simply fetch data inside of your page's code fence.

Migrate the following:

```vue title="pages/index.vue"
{
  // ...
  async asyncData() {
    const res = await fetch("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=151")
    const resJson = await res.json();
    const pokemons = resJson.results;
    return {
      pokemons,
    }
  },
}
```

To a code fence without a wrapper function:

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
---
const res = await fetch("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=151")
const resJson = await res.json();
const pokemons = resJson.results;
---

<!-- Your template here -->
```

### Nuxt Styling to Astro

Nuxt utilizes Vue's component styling to generate a page's style.

```vue title="pages/index.vue"
<template>
	<!-- Your template here -->
</template>

<script>
	// Your server logic here
</script>

<style scoped>
    .class {
        color: red;
    }
</style>
```

 Similarly, in Astro you can drop in a `<style>` element in your page's template to style the component:

```astro title="src/pages/index.vue"
---
// Your server logic here
---

<style>
    .class {
        color: red;
    }
</style>
```

#### Global Styling

`<style>`  tags are `scoped` by default in Astro. To make a `<style>` tag global, mark it with the `is:global` attribute:

```astro title="src/pages/index.vue"
<style is:global> 
	p {
		color: red;
	}
</style>
```



#### Pre-processor support

[Astro supports the most popular CSS preprocessors right out of the box](/en/guides/styling/#css-preprocessors) by installing them as a dev dependency. For example, to use SCSS you'd run:

```shell
npm install -D sass
```

After doing so, you're then able to use `.scss` or `.sass` styled without modification from your Vue components.

```astro title="src/layouts/Layout.astro"
<p>Hello, world</p>
<style lang="scss">
p {
   color: black;
   
   &:hover {
       color: red;
   }
}
</style>
```

See more about [Styling in Astro](/en/guides/styling/).

### Nuxt Image Plugin to Astro

Convert any [Nuxt `<nuxt-img/>` or `<nuxt-picture/>` components](https://image.nuxtjs.org/components/nuxt-img) with [Astro's own image integration components](/en/guides/images/#astros-image-integration), or with a standard HTML `<img>` tag.

You can learn more about [using images in Astro](/en/guides/images/) in the Images Guide.

## Guided examples: See the steps!

Here is an example of small NuxtJS Pokédex application converted to Astro.

This walks through converting three individual files to `.astro` files:

- `layouts/default.vue` for providing a layout becomes `src/layouts/Layout.astro`
- `pages/index.vue` Pokemon list page becomes `src/pages/index.astro`
- `pages/pokemon/_name.js` for dynamic routing becomes `src/pages/[name].astro`
