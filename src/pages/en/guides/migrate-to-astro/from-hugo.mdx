[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is an open-source static site generator built on Go.

## Key Similarities between Hugo and Astro

Hugo and Astro share some similarities that will help you migrate your project:

- Hugo and Astro are both modern static-site generators, ideally suited to content-focused sites like blogs.

- Hugo and Astro both allow you to author your content in Markdown. However, Hugo allows you to write frontmatter in YAML, TOML or JSON and recognizes several special properties while allowing for custom properties. Astro recognizes YAML frontmatter, but has very few reserved frontmatter properties. Almost all of your frontmatter will be user-defined. Even though many of your existing Hugo frontmatter properties will not be "special" in Astro, this metadata can be accessed and used by Astro components. So, you can continue to use your existing Markdown files and frontmatter values.

- Hugo and Astro both allow you to enhance your site with a variety of plugins and external packages.



## Key Differences between Hugo and Astro

When you rebuild your Hugo site in Astro, you will notice some important differences:

- Hugo uses Go for page templating. Astro syntax is a JSX-like superset of HTML.

- Hugo sites are created using Markdown (`.md`) files for page content and HTML (`.html`) templates for layout. Astro is component-based, and uses Astro components, which include HTML templating for pages, layouts and individual UI elements. Astro can also create pages from `.md` and `.mdx` files, using an Astro layout component for wrapping Markdown content in a page template.

- Astro does not use shortcodes for dynamic content in standard Markdown files, but it does allow you to use JSX and import components in MDX files.

- While Hugo can use "partials" for reusable layout elements, Astro is entirely component-based. Any `.astro` file can be a component, a layout or an entire page, and can import and render any other Astro components. Astro components can also render other UI framework components (e.g. React, Svelte, Vue, Solid) as well as content or metadata from other files in your project, such as Markdown or MDX.

## Switch from Hugo to Astro

To convert a Hugo blog to Astro, start with our blog theme starter template, or explore more community blog themes in our [theme showcase](https://astro.build/themes/). 

Bring your existing Markdown (or MDX, with our optional integration) files as content to [create Markdown or MDX pages](/en/guides/markdown-content/). You may need to convert your frontmatter to YAML, since Astro only allows YAML frontmatter in these files.

To continue to use dynamic content such as variables, expressions or UI components within your Markdown content, add Astro's optional MDX integration and convert your existing Markdown files to [MDX pages](/en/guides/markdown-content/). MDX supports YAML frontmatter, so you can keep your existing frontmatter properties. But, you must replace any shortcode syntax with [MDX's own syntax](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/#mdx-syntax), which allows JSX expressions and/or component imports.

To convert other types of sites, such as a portfolio or documentation site, see more official starter templates on [astro.new](https://astro.new) with links to a GitHub repository as well as one-click links to open a working project in StackBlitz, CodeSandbox and Gitpod online development environments.
