Markdown content is commonly used to author text-heavy content like blog posts and documentation. Astro includes built-in support for standard Markdown (`.md`) files. With the [@astrojs/mdx integration](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/), Astro supports MDX (`.mdx`) files which bring added features like support for JavaScript expressions and components right in your Markdown.

## Markdown Pages

Astro treats any `.md` or `.mdx` file inside of the `/src/pages/` directory as a page. Placing a file in this directory, or any sub-directory, will automatically build a page route using the pathname of the file.

📚 Read more about Astro's [file-based routing](/en/core-concepts/routing/).

### Basic Example

To start using Markdown in Astro, add a new file `page-1.md` to your project in the `src/pages/` folder. Copy the basic template below into your file, and then view the rendered HTML in your browser preview. Usually, this is at [http://localhost:3000/page-1](http://localhost:3000/page-1).



```markdown
---
# Example: src/pages/page-1.md
title: Hello, World
---

# Hi there!

This is your first markdown page. It probably isn't styled much, although
Markdown does support **bold** and _italics._

To learn more about adding a layout to your page, read the next section on **Markdown Layouts.**
```

### Markdown Layouts

In Astro, Markdown and MDX pages have a special frontmatter property for `layout` that defines the relative path to an Astro [layout component](/en/core-concepts/layouts/). This component will wrap your Markdown content, providing a page shell and any other included page template elements.

```markdown
---
// src/pages/page.md
layout: ../layouts/BaseLayout.astro
---
```

A typical layout for Markdown pages includes:

1. the content prop to access the Markdown page's frontmatter and other data.
2. a default [`<slot />`](/en/core-concepts/astro-components/#slots) to indicate where the page's Markdown content should be rendered.

```astro /(?<!//.*){?content(?:\\.\w+)?}?/ "<slot />"
---
// src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro
// 1. The content prop gives access to frontmatter and other data
const { content } = Astro.props;
---
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Add other Head elements here, like styles and meta tags. -->
    <title>{content.title}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Add other UI components here, like common headers and footers. -->
    <h1>{content.title} by {content.author}</h1>
    <!-- 2. Rendered HTML will be passed into the default slot. -->
    <slot />
    <p>Written on: {content.date}</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

The `content` prop also contains an `astro` property with additional metadata about the page such as the complete Markdown `source` and a `headers` object.

An example blog post `content` object might look like:

```json
{
  /** Frontmatter from a blog post
  "title": "Astro 0.18 Release",
  "date": "Tuesday, July 27 2021",
  "author": "Matthew Phillips",
  "description": "Astro 0.18 is our biggest release since Astro launch.",
  "draft": false,
  "keywords": ["astro", "release", "announcement"]
  **/
  "astro": {
    "headers": [
      {
        "depth": 1,
        "text": "Astro 0.18 Release",
        "slug": "astro-018-release"
      },
      {
        "depth": 2,
        "text": "Responsive partial hydration",
        "slug": "responsive-partial-hydration"
      }
      /* ... */
    ],
    "source": "# Astro 0.18 Release\nA little over a month ago, the first public beta [...]"
  },
  "url": "",
  "file": ""
}
```

:::note
`astro`, `file`, and `url` are the only guaranteed properties provided by Astro in the Markdown `content` prop. The rest of the object is defined by your frontmatter variables.

📚 Read more about the [MDX `content` prop](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) and how it compares to the Markdown `content` object.

:::

#### Layouts for multiple page types

An Astro layout can receive both the content object from `.md` and `.mdx` files, as well as any named props passed from `.astro` files.

In the example below, the layout will display the page title either from an Astro component passing a `title` attribute, or from a frontmatter YAML `title` property:

```astro /{?title}?/ /Astro.props[.a-z]*/
---
// src/components/MyLayout.astro
const { title } = Astro.props.content || Astro.props;
---
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <h1>{title}</h1>
    <slot />
  </body>
</html>
```

### Heading IDs

Astro will add autogenerated ids to all headings in Markdown files automatically using [github-slugger](https://github.com/Flet/github-slugger). But, if a custom id is specified, it won't be overriden.

These ids will be added _after_ all the other plugins are executed, so if you have a plugin like `rehype-toc` that needs ids, you should add your own slugging plugin (like `rehype-slug`).

### Markdown Drafts

`draft: true` is an optional frontmatter value that will mark an individual `.md` page or post as "unpublished." By default, this page will be excluded from the site build.

Markdown pages without the `draft` property or those with `draft: false` are unaffected and will be included in the final build.

```markdown {5}
---
# src/pages/post/blog-post.md
layout: ../../layouts/BaseLayout.astro
title: My Blog Post
draft: true
---

This is my in-progress blog post.

No page will be built for this post.

To build and publish this post:

- update the frontmatter to `draft: false` or
- remove the `draft` property entirely.
```

:::caution[Drafts and Astro.glob()]
Although `draft: true` will prevent a page from being built on your site at that page route, [`Astro.glob()`](/en/reference/api-reference/#astroglob) currently returns **all your Markdown files**.
:::

To exclude draft posts from being included in a post archive, or list of most recent posts, you can filter the results returned by your `Astro.glob()`.

```js
const posts = await Astro.glob('../pages/post/*.md');
const nonDraftPosts = posts.filter((post) => !post.frontmatter.draft);
```

⚙️ To enable building draft pages:

Add `drafts: true` to `markdown` in `astro.config.mjs`

```js ins={4}
// astro.config.mjs
export default defineConfig({
  markdown: {
    drafts: true,
  },
});
```

:::tip
You can also pass the `--drafts` flag when running `astro build` to build draft pages!
:::

## Astro Markdown

:::caution[Deprecated]
Astro v1.0 Release Candidate (RC) [no longer supports components or JSX in Markdown pages by default](/en/migrate/#deprecated-components-and-jsx-in-markdown) and may be removed in a future release. 

In the meantime, Astro config supports a [legacy flag](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#legacyastroflavoredmarkdown) that will re-enable these features in Markdown pages until you are able to migrate to MDX in Astro.
:::

### Using Variables in Markdown

Please install the official [`@astrojs/mdx`](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) integration to continue to use [variables and JSX expressions in MDX (`.mdx`) files](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/#variables).

See the migration guide for help [converting your existing Astro `.md` files to `.mdx`](/en/migrate/#converting-existing-md-files-to-mdx).

### Using Components in Markdown

Please install the official [`@astrojs/mdx`](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) integration to continue to use [Astro components](/en/core-concepts/astro-components/) or [UI framework components](/en/core-concepts/framework-components/) in MDX (`.mdx`) files.

See the migration guide for help [converting your existing Astro `.md` files to `.mdx`](/en/migrate/#converting-existing-md-files-to-mdx).


## MDX

Astro includes full support for MDX with the [official `@astrojs/mdx` integration](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/). 

Any `.mdx` page located in your project within `src/pages` will automatically generate a page route. 

📚 Read more about using MDX in Astro in our [MDX integration guide](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/).

### Using Variables in MDX

With the `@astrojs/mdx` integration, you can use [variables and JSX expressions in MDX (`.mdx`) files](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/#variables).


### Using Components in MDX

With the `@astrojs/mdx` integration, you can use Astro or UI framework components in MDX (`.mdx`) files just as you would [use them in any other Astro component](/en/core-concepts/framework-components/#using-framework-components).

Don't forget to include a `client:directive` if necessary!


## Importing Markdown

You can import Markdown files directly into your Astro files! You can import one specific page with `import` or multiple pages with `Astro.glob()`.

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" {3,6}
---
// Import some markdown. Dynamic import() is also supported!
import * as greatPost from '../pages/post/great-post.md';

// Also, you can import multiple files with Astro.glob
const posts = await Astro.glob('../pages/post/*.md');
---

A Great Post: <a href={greatPost.url}>{greatPost.frontmatter.title}</a>

<ul>
  {posts.map(post => <li>{post.frontmatter.title}</li>)}
</ul>
```

You can optionally provide a type for the `frontmatter` variable using a TypeScript generic:

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" ins={2-5} ins="<Frontmatter>"
---
interface Frontmatter {
  title: string;
  description?: string;
}
const posts = await Astro.glob<Frontmatter>('../pages/post/*.md');
---

<ul>
  {posts.map(post => <li>{post.title}</li>)}
  <!-- post.title will be `string`! -->
</ul>
```

### Exported Properties

Each Markdown file exports the following properties.

#### `frontmatter`

Contains any data specified in this file's YAML frontmatter.

#### `file`

The absolute path of this file (e.g. `/home/user/projects/.../file.md`).

#### `url`

If it's a page, URL of the page (e.g. `/en/guides/markdown-content`).

#### `getHeaders()`

An async function that returns the headers of the Markdown file. The response follows this type: `{ depth: number; slug: string; text: string }[]`.

#### `rawContent()`

A function that returns the raw content of the Markdown file (excluding the frontmatter block) as a string.

:::tip
If you plan to use `rawContent` for calculating values like "reading time," we suggest using a remark plugin to inject frontmatter instead! See [our reading time example](#example-calculate-reading-time) for more.
:::

#### `compiledContent()`

A function that returns the parsed HTML document as a string. Note **this does not include layouts configured in your frontmatter**! Only the markdown document itself will be returned as HTML. 

:::caution
**[For `legacy.astroFlavoredMarkdown` users](http://localhost:3000/en/reference/configuration-reference/#legacyastroflavoredmarkdown):** This does not parse `{jsx expressions}` or `<Components />`. Only standard Markdown blocks like `## headings` and `- lists` will be parsed to HTML.
:::

#### `Content`

A component that returns the full rendered contents of the Markdown file. Here is an example:

```astro title="src/pages/content.astro" "Content"
---
import {Content as PromoBanner} from '../components/promoBanner.md';
---

<h2>Today's promo</h2>
<PromoBanner />
```

When using `getStaticPaths` and `Astro.glob()` to generate pages from Markdown files, you can pass the `<Content/>` component through the page’s `props`. You can then retrieve the component from `Astro.props` and render it in your template. 

```astro title="src/pages/[slug].astro" {9-11} "Content" "Astro.props.post"
---
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const posts = await Astro.glob('../posts/**/*.md')

  return posts.map(post => ({
    params: { 
      slug: post.frontmatter.slug 
    },
    props: {
      post
    },
  }))
}

const { Content } = Astro.props.post
---
<article>
  <Content/>
</article>
```

## Configuring Markdown

Markdown support in Astro is powered by [remark](https://remark.js.org/), a powerful parsing and processing tool with an active ecosystem. Other Markdown parsers like Pandoc and markdown-it are not currently supported.

You can customize how remark parses your Markdown in `astro.config.mjs`. See [the reference documentation](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#markdown-options) for full configuration details or follow our guides below on how to add remark plugins and customize syntax highlighting.

### Markdown Plugins

Astro supports third-party [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) and [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) plugins for Markdown. You can provide your plugins in `astro.config.mjs`.

:::note
Enabling custom `remarkPlugins` or `rehypePlugins` will remove these built-in plugins and you need to explicitly add these plugins if desired.

By default, Astro comes with [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm) and [remark-smartypants](https://github.com/silvenon/remark-smartypants) pre-enabled.
:::

#### How to add a Markdown plugin in Astro

1. Install the npm package dependency in your project.

2. Update `remarkPlugins` or `rehypePlugins` inside the `markdown` options:

    ```js
    // astro.config.mjs
    export default {
      markdown: {
        remarkPlugins: [
          // Add a Remark plugin that you want to enable for your project.
          // If you need to provide options for the plugin, you can use an array and put the options as the second item.
          // ['remark-autolink-headings', { behavior: 'prepend'}],
        ],
        rehypePlugins: [
          // Add a Rehype plugin that you want to enable for your project.
          // If you need to provide options for the plugin, you can use an array and put the options as the second item.
          // 'rehype-slug',
          // ['rehype-autolink-headings', { behavior: 'prepend'}],
        ],
      },
    };
    ```

    You can provide names of the plugins as well as import them:

    ```js ins={2,6}
    // astro.config.mjs
    import autolinkHeadings from 'remark-autolink-headings';

    export default {
      markdown: {
        remarkPlugins: [[autolinkHeadings, { behavior: 'prepend' }]],
      },
    };
    ```

### Injecting frontmatter

You may want to add frontmatter properties to your markdown files programmatically. By using a [remark or rehype plugin](#markdown-plugins), you can generate these properties based on a file's contents.

You can append to the `data.astro.frontmatter` property from your plugin's `file` argument like so:

```js
// example-remark-plugin.js
export function exampleRemarkPlugin() {
  // All remark and rehype plugins return a separate function
  return function (tree, file) {
    file.data.astro.frontmatter.customProperty = 'Generated property';
  }
}
```

After applying this plugin to your `markdown` config:

```js
// astro.config.mjs
import { exampleRemarkPlugin } from './example-remark-plugin';

export default {
  markdown: {
    remarkPlugins: [exampleRemarkPlugin],
  },
};

```

...every markdown file will have `customProperty` in its frontmatter! This is available when [importing your markdown](#importing-markdown) and from [the `Astro.props.frontmatter` property in your layouts](#markdown-layouts).

#### Example: calculate reading time

You can use a [remark plugin](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) to add a reading time to your frontmatter. We recommend a couple helper packages:
- [`reading-time`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reading-time) to calculate minutes read
- [`mdast-util-to-string`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mdast-util-to-string) to extract all text from your markdown

```shell
npm i reading-time mdast-util-to-string
```

We can apply these packages to a remark plugin like so:

```js
// remark-reading-time.js
import getReadingTime from 'reading-time';
import { toString } from 'mdast-util-to-string';

export function remarkReadingTime() {
	return function (tree, { data }) {
    const textOnPage = toString(tree);
		const readingTime = getReadingTime(textOnPage);
    // readingTime.text will give us minutes read as a friendly string,
    // i.e. "3 min read"
		data.astro.frontmatter.minutesRead = readingTime.text;
	};
}
```

Once you apply this plugin your config:

```js
// astro.config.mjs
import { remarkReadingTime } from './remark-reading-time';

export default {
  markdown: {
    remarkPlugins: [remarkReadingTime],
  },
};

```

...all markdown documents will have a calculated `minutesRead`. You can use this to apply an "X min read" banner from a [markdown layout](#markdown-layouts), for instance:

```astro
<!--src/layouts/BlogLayout.astro-->
---
const { minutesRead } = Astro.props.content;
---

<html>
  <head>...</head>
  <body>
    <p>{minutesRead}</p>
    <slot />
  </body>
</html>
```

### Syntax Highlighting

Astro comes with built-in support for [Shiki](https://shiki.matsu.io/) and [Prism](https://prismjs.com/). This provides instant syntax highlighting for:

- all code fences (\`\`\`) used in a markdown (`.md`) file.
- content within the [built-in `<Code />` component](/en/reference/api-reference/#code-) (powered by Shiki), or the [`<Prism />` component](/en/reference/api-reference/#prism-) (powered by Prism).

Shiki is enabled by default, preconfigured with the `github-dark` theme. The compiled output will be limited to inline `style`s without any extraneous CSS classes, stylesheets, or client-side JS.

If you opt to use Prism, we will apply Prism's CSS classes instead. Note that **you need to bring your own CSS stylesheet** for syntax highlighting to appear! See the [Prism configuration section](#prism-configuration) for more details.

#### Choose a syntax highlighter

Shiki is our default syntax highlighter. If you'd like to switch to `'prism'` or disable syntax highlighting entirely, you can use the `markdown` config object:

```js ins={5}
// astro.config.mjs
export default {
  markdown: {
    // Can be 'shiki' (default), 'prism' or false to disable highlighting
    syntaxHighlight: 'prism',
  },
};
```

#### Shiki configuration

When using Shiki, you'll configure all options via the `shikiConfig` object like so:

```js
// astro.config.mjs
export default {
  markdown: {
    shikiConfig: {
      // Choose from Shiki's built-in themes (or add your own)
      // https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/main/docs/themes.md
      theme: 'dracula',
      // Add custom languages
      // Note: Shiki has countless langs built-in, including .astro!
      // https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/main/docs/languages.md
      langs: [],
      // Enable word wrap to prevent horizontal scrolling
      wrap: true,
    },
  },
};
```

We also suggest [diving into their theme documentation](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/main/docs/themes.md#loading-theme) to explore loading custom theme, light vs dark mode toggles, or styling via CSS variables.

#### Prism configuration

When using Prism, you'll need to add a stylesheet to your project for syntax highlighting. If you're just getting started and prefer to use Prism over Shiki, we suggest:

1. [Setting `syntaxHighlight: 'prism'`](#choose-a-syntax-highlighter) from your `@astrojs/markdown-remark` config.
1. Choosing a premade stylesheet from the available [Prism Themes](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes).
2. Adding this stylesheet to [your project's `public/` directory](/en/core-concepts/project-structure/#public).
3. Loading this [into your page's `<head>`](/en/core-concepts/astro-pages/#page-html) via a `<link>` tag.

You can also visit the [list of languages supported by Prism](https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages) for options and usage.
