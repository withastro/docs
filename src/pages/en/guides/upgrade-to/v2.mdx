## Astro 2.0 Breaking Changes

Astro v2.0 includes some breaking changes, as well as the removal of some previously deprecated features. If your project doesn't work as expected after upgrading to v2.0, check this guide for an overview of all breaking changes and instructions on how to update your codebase.

See [the changelog](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/astro/CHANGELOG.md) for full release notes.


### Updated: Vite 4

Astro v2.0 upgrades from Vite 3 to [Vite 4](https://vitejs.dev/), released in December 2022.

#### What should I do?

There should be no changes to your code necessary! We've handled most of the upgrade for you inside of Astro; however, some subtle Vite behaviors may still change between versions. 

Refer to the official [Vite Migration Guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/migration.html) if you run into trouble.

### Removed: Support for Node 14

Node 14 is scheduled to reach its End of Life in April 2023. 

Astro 2.0 drops Node 14 support entirely, so that all Astro users can take advantage of Node's more modern features.

#### What should I do?

 Check that both your development environment and your deployment environment are using **Node.js `16.12.0` or later**.

1. Check your local version of node using:

    ```sh
    node -v
 
    ```
    If your local development environment needs upgrading, [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).


2. Check your [deployment environment's](/en/guides/deploy/) own documentation to verify that they support Node 16. 

    You can specify Node `16.12.0` for your Astro project either in a dashboard configuration setting, or a `.nvmrc` file.


### Removed: `legacy.astroFlavoredMarkdown`

In 1.0, Astro moved the old Astro Flavored Markdown (also known as Components in Markdown) to a legacy feature. 

Astro 2.0 removes the `legacy.astroFlavoredMarkdown` option completely. Importing and using components in `.md` files will no longer work.

#### What should I do?

Remove this legacy flag. It is no longer available in Astro.

```js del={3-5}
// astro.config.mjs
export default defineConfig({
	legacy: {
		astroFlavoredMarkdown: true,
	},
})

```

If you were using this feature in 1.x, we recommend [using the MDX integration](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) which allows you to include components and JSX expressions in your Markdown.

### Removed: `Astro.resolve()`

In 0.24, Astro deprecated `Astro.resolve()` for getting resolved URLs to assets that you might want to reference in the browser.

Astro 2.0 removes this option entirely. `Astro.resolve()` in your code will cause an error.

#### What should I do?

Resolve asset paths using `import` instead. For example:

```astro
// src/pages/index.astro
---
import 'style.css';
import imageUrl from './image.png';
---

<img src={imageUrl} />
```

### Removed: `Astro.fetchContent()`

In 0.26, Astro deprecated `Astro.fetchContent()`for fetching data from your local Markdown files.

Astro 2.0 removes this option entirely. `Astro.fetchContent()` in your code will cause an error.

#### What should I do?

Use [`Astro.glob()`](/en/guides/imports/#astroglob) to fetch Markdown files, or convert to the [Content Collections](/en/guides/content-collections/) feature.

```astro
// src/pages/index.astro
---
let allPosts = await Astro.glob('./posts/*.md');
---
```

### Removed: `Astro.canonicalURL`

In 1.0, Astro deprecated `Astro.canonicalURL` for constructing a canonical URL. 


Astro 2.0 removes this option entirely. `Astro.canonicalURL()` in your code will cause an error.

#### What should I do?

Use `Astro.url` to construct a canonical URL.

```astro
// src/pages/index.astro
---
const canonicalURL = new URL(Astro.url.pathname, Astro.site);
---

```

### Changed: `_astro/` folder for build assets

In 1.0, assets were built to various locations, including `assets/`, `chunks/` and the root of the build output.

Astro 2.0 moves and unifies the location of all build output assets to a new `_astro/` folder. 

<FileTree>
- dist/
  - _astro
    - client.9218e799.js
    - index.df3f880e0.css
</FileTree>

You can control this location with the [new `build.assets` configuration option](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#buildassets).

#### What should I do?

Update your configuration with your deployment platform if your deployment relies on the location of these assets. 


### Changed: Markdown plugin configuration

#### Removed: `extendDefaultPlugins`

Astro 2.0 removes `markdown.extendDefaultPlugins` for controlling Astro's default plugin behavior when adding your own plugins. 

Applying remark and rehype plugins in your Markdown configuration  **no longer disables Astro's default plugins**, so this option is no longer needed.

GitHub-Flavored Markdown and Smartypants are now applied whether or not custom `remarkPlugins` or `rehypePlugins` are configured. (You can opt out manually by setting the [new `gfm` and `smartypants` options](#added-gfm-and-smartypants) to `false` in your config.)


##### What should I do?

Remove `extendDefaultPlugins: true` in your configuration. This is now Astro's default behavior in 2.0, and you can delete this line without any replacement.

```js del={6}
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  markdown: {
    extendDefaultPlugins: true,
  }
});
```

#### Added: `gfm` and `smartypants`

Astro 2.0 replaces `markdown.extendDefaultPlugins` with separate Boolean options to control each of Astro's built-in default Markdown plugins individually. These are enabled by default, and can be set to `false` to remove each plugin independently.

##### What should I do?

Replace `extendDefaultPlugins: false` and add the flags to disable each plugin individually instead.

- `markdown.gfm: false` disables GitHub-Flavored Markdown
- `markdown.smartypants: false` disables SmartyPants

```js del={6} ins={7-8}
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  markdown: {
    extendDefaultPlugins: false,
    smartypants: false,
    gfm: false,
  }
});
```

### Changed: MDX plugin configuration

#### Replaced: `extendPlugins` -> `extendMarkdownConfig`

In 1.0, `.mdx.extendPlugins` managed how your MDX files should inherit your Markdown plugin configuration. This setting was used to indicate whether all Markdown plugins (`markdown`), or only Astro's default plugins (`defaults`) should be applied to MDX.

Astro 2.0 replaces `mdx.extendPlugins` with three new, independently-configurable options:

- **[`mdx.extendMarkdownConfig`](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/#extendmarkdownconfig)** (`true` by default) to inherit all of your Markdown configuration or none of it.
- **`mdx.gfm`** (`true` by default) to enable or disable GitHub-Flavored Markdown in MDX.
- **`mdx.smartypants`** (`true` by default) to enable or disable SmartyPants in MDX.

 ##### What should I do?

Delete `extendPlugins: 'markdown'` in your configuration. This is now default behavior. 

```js del={6}
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  mdx: {
    extendPlugins: markdown,
  }
});
```

Replace `extendPlugins: 'defaults'` with `extendMarkdownConfig: false` and add the [separate options for GitHub-Flavored Markdown and SmartyPants](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/#options-inherited-from-markdown-config) to enable these default plugins individually in MDX.

```js del={6} ins={7-9}
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  mdx: {
    extendPlugins: defaults,
    extendMarkdownConfig: false,
    smartypants: true,
    gfm: true,
  }
});
```

#### Added: More MDX config options to match Markdown

Setting `extendMarkdownConfig: false` now allows you to individually set [every available Markdown configuration option](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#markdown-options) (except `drafts`) separately in your MDX integration configuration.

```js
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx';

export default defineConfig({
  markdown: {
    syntaxHighlight: 'prism',
    remarkPlugins: [remarkPlugin1],
    gfm: true,
  },
  integrations: [
    mdx({
      // `syntaxHighlight` inherited from Markdown

      // Markdown `remarkPlugins` ignored,
      // only `remarkPlugin2` applied.
      remarkPlugins: [remarkPlugin2],
      // `gfm` overridden to `false`
      gfm: false,
    })
  ]
});
```

##### What should I do?

Revisit your Markdown and MDX configuration and compare your existing config with the new options available.

:::tip[remember]
- Astro's two default Markdown plugins are now individually configurable, and are not removed when you add other plugins. No more extending defaults!
- The option to extend your Markdown plugin config to MDX has moved from a selection (just defaults or all plugins) to toggle (all or none).
- Every Markdown config option (except drafts) can also be configured independently in MDX!
:::

### Added: Plugin access to frontmatter

In 1.0, remark and rehype plugins did not have access to user frontmatter. Astro merged plugin frontmatter with your file's frontmatter, without passing the file frontmatter to your plugins.

Astro 2.0 gives remark and rehype plugins access to user frontmatter via frontmatter injection. This allows plugin authors to modify a user's existing frontmatter, or compute new properties based on other properties.


#### What should I do?

Check any remark and rehype plugins you have written to see whether their behavior has changed. Note that `data.astro.frontmatter` is now the _complete_ Markdown or MDX document's frontmatter, rather than an empty object.

### Reserved: `src/content/`

In 1.0, the [Collections API was hidden behind an experimental flag](#astro-20-experimental-flags-removed). This API reserves `src/content/` as a special folder.

Astro 2.0 now includes the Collections API in the core codebase for organizing your Markdown and MDX files into [content collections](/en/guides/content-collections/).

#### What should I do?

Rename an existing `src/content/` folder to avoid conflicts. This folder, if it exists, can now only be used for [content collections](/en/guides/content-collections/).

## Astro 2.0 Experimental Flags Removed

Astro v2.0 brings some new features from experimental flags into the core codebase.

#### What should I do?

Remove the following experimental flags from `astro.config.mjs`:

```js del={5-8}
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  experimental: {
    contentCollections: true,
    prerender: true,
    errorOverlay: true,
  },
})
```

These features are now available by default:

- [Content collections](/en/guides/content-collections/) as a way to manage your Markdown and MDX files with type-safety.
- [Prerendering individual pages to static HTML](/en/guides/server-side-rendering/#prerendering) when using SSR to improve speed and cacheability.
- A redesigned error message overlay.

## Known Issues

There are currently no known issues.
