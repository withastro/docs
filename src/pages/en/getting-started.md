#### What is Astro?

Astro is an **all-in-one** **web framework** for building **fast,** **content-focused** websites. 

#### Key Features

- **Component Islands:** A new web architecture for building faster websites.
- **Server-first API design:** Move expensive hydration off of your users' devices.
- **Zero JS, by default:** No JavaScript runtime overhead to slow you down.
- **Edge-ready:** Deploy anywhere, even a global edge runtime like Deno or Cloudflare.
- **Customizable:** Tailwind, MDX, and 100+ other integrations to choose from.
- **UI-agnostic:** Supports React, Preact, Svelte, Vue, Solid, Lit and more.

<!-- - **`client:visible` component loading:** If your user never sees it, it never loads. -->
