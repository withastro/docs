<Goals>
  - generated multiple page routes dynamically from a single Astro component
  - used `[bracket]` notation to identify the dynamic route parameter
  - exported a `getStaticPaths()` function to specify exactly which paths will be built
</Goals>

## Dynamic Page Routing

Adding `.astro` and `.md` files within `src/pages/` creates a new **static** page on your website. You can also create entire sets of pages dynamically using `getStaticPaths()`. This function written in an Astro component script returns an array of page routes, and all of the pages at those routes will use the same component template.

To see the difference, you will first create a new static Tags page, and then convert it into an `.astro` page component that creates multiple routes dynamically: one for every blog tag you use on the site. The component's template will be used to create all of the associated pages on your website.

### Create a static page placeholder

1. Create a new file in `src/pages/tags/` (you will make a new folder) with the filename `tag.astro` and add the following code:

    ```astro title="src/pages/tags/tag.astro"
    ---
    import BaseLayout from '../../layouts/BaseLayout.astro';
    const title = "tag"; 
    ---
    <BaseLayout title={title}>
      <p>Posts tagged with {title}</p>
    </BaseLayout>
    ```

2. Visit `localhost:3000/tags/tag` in your browser (or add `/tags/tag` to the end of your preview URL) and verify that you have a new page on your site.

## Create a Dynamic Page

1. Convert this static route (one file -> one page) to a dynamic route (one file -> many pages) by
    - **renaming the file to `[tag].astro`** (add brackets around the word "tag")
    - **exporting a `getStaticPaths()` function** in the component script.

    ```astro title="src/pages/posts/tags/[tag].astro" ins={4-11,14-15} del={13}
    ---
    import BaseLayout from '../../layouts/BaseLayout.astro';

    export async function getStaticPaths({ }) {
      return[
        {params: {tag: "astro"}},
        {params: {tag: "sucesses"}},
        {params: {tag: "community"}},
        {params: {tag: "learning in public"}}
      ]
    }

    const title = "tag"; 
    const { tag } = Astro.params
    let title = tag; 
    ---
    <BaseLayout title={title}>
      <p>Posts tagged with {title}</p>    
    </BaseLayout>
    ```

2. Visit `localhost:3000/tags/astro` in your browser preview and you should see a page, generated dynamically from `[tag].astro`. Check that you also have pages created at `/tags/successes`, `/tags/community`, and `/tags/learning%20in%20public`. 

    Each of these pages uses the same component template to create what you see on the page, which means they each have access to their parameter value of `tag` for that page, but nothing else... yet!

    In addition to defining a parameter for each route, let's give each page some props.

3. Add code to your `getStaticPaths()` function in order to make data from all your blog posts available to each page route.

    Be sure to give each route in your array the new props, and then make those props available to your component template outside of your function.

    ```astro title="src/pages/posts/tags/[tag].astro" ins={5,17} "props: {posts: allPosts}" 
    ---
    import BaseLayout from '../../layouts/BaseLayout.astro';

    export async function getStaticPaths({ }) {
      const allPosts = await Astro.glob('../posts/*.md');

      return [
        {params: {tag: "astro"}, props: {posts: allPosts}},
        {params: {tag: "sucesses"}, props: {posts: allPosts}},
        {params: {tag: "community"}, props: {posts: allPosts}},
        {params: {tag: "blogging"}, props: {posts: allPosts}},
        {params: {tag: "setbacks"}, props: {posts: allPosts}},
        {params: {tag: "learning in public"}, props: {posts: allPosts}}
      ]
    }

    const { posts } = Astro.props
    const { tag } = Astro.params
    let title = tag;
    ```

## Analyze the pattern

For each of the following, state whether the code is written **inside** the `getStaticPath()` function, or **outside** of it, in your component script.

1. The `Astro.glob()` call to receive information about all your `.md` files to pass to each page route.

    <MultipleChoice>
    <Option isCorrect>inside `getStaticPaths`</Option>
    <Option>outside `getStaticPaths`</Option>
    </MultipleChoice>

2. The list of routes to be generated (returned) by `getStaticPaths()`

    <MultipleChoice>
    <Option isCorrect>inside `getStaticPaths`</Option>
    <Option>outside `getStaticPaths`</Option>
    </MultipleChoice>

3. Definitions of values to be used by each individual page in the component template.

    <MultipleChoice>
    <Option>inside `getStaticPaths`</Option>
    <Option isCorrect>outside `getStaticPaths`</Option>
    </MultipleChoice>

:::note[Takeaway]
To **give** information to a page route, write it **inside** `getStaticPaths()`.

To **use** information in the HTML template of a page route, write it **outside** `getStaticPaths()`.
:::

## Using props in dynamic routes

Now you can update your HTML template to include information from each blog post. 

1. To list all of your posts on each of these new dynamically-generated tag pages, add the following code to the template of `[tag].astro`:

    ```astro title="src/pages/posts/tags/[tag].astro" ins={3-5}
    <BaseLayout title={title}>   
      <p>Posts tagged with {title}</p>
      <ul>
        {posts.map(post => <li><a href={post.url}>{post.frontmatter.title}</a></li>)}
      </ul>
    </BaseLayout>
    ```
  (You will narrow down this list to include only the posts containing the tag in a later step!)

2. You can even refactor this to use your `<BlogPost />` component instead! (Don't forget to import this component at the top of `[tag].astro`, along with your layout, so that you can use it.)

    ```astro title="src/pages/posts/tags/[tag].astro" del={4} ins={5}
    <BaseLayout title={title}>
      <p>Posts tagged with {title}</p>
      <ul>
        {posts.map(post => <li><a href={post.url}>{post.frontmatter.title}</a></li>)}        
        {posts.map(post => <BlogPost url={post.url} title={post.frontmatter.title}/>)}
      </ul>
    </BaseLayout>
    ```

3. Check your browser preview and you should now see a list of all of your blog posts on every tag page. 

    But, that's not very helpful! You would like to display only the posts that contain that particular tag.


## Advanced: Showing only posts with matching tags

:::note
Even if it looks challenging, try following along with the steps to build this function yourself! But, if you don't want to walk through the JavaScript required right now, you can skip ahead to the [finished version of the code](#final-code-sample) and add it directly to your project.
:::

Let's start by planning out the steps.

Replace your existing `getStaticPaths()` with the following **pseudocode** (a description in words of what you would _like_ your code to do, but not the actual code to execute it) in your `getStaticPaths()` function:

```astro title="src/pages/posts/tags/[tag].astro"
---
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // 1. Retrieve data from all Markdown posts.
 
  // 2. Create a new `Set` for holding all the tags used on the blog.
  
  // 3. Loop through all the Markdown files, and add any tags found to the Set of tags.

  // 4. Turn your Set of tags into an array you can map through.

  // 5. For each tag in the array, filter your blog posts to find only the ones that include it 
  //    Then, return 
  //    - the name of the tag (for defining the parameters your page routes)
  //    - an array of posts that include the tag (to be passed as props to each page).
}
---
```
You will tackle each piece individually. Some of the steps you have already seen!

### Constructing `getStaticPaths()`

We have five tasks written in pseudocode to turn into code. Some will be shorter, and some will be longer.  Some of them you will be familiar with, but some of them might be new to you. That's OK! By the end, you'll have working code that you can inspect further if you need to.

Remember, each of these sections of code will be written _inside_ your `getStaticPaths()` function, in the order they appear.

### 1. Retrieve data from all Markdown posts

This should look familiar! You have written this line of code before:

```js title="src/pages/posts/tags/[tag].astro"
  // 1. Retrieve data from all Markdown posts.
  const allPosts = await Astro.glob('../pages/posts/*.md');
```

### 2. Create a `Set` that will hold your tags

A `Set` is a JavaScript object that is a collection of unique items. It is similar to an array, but it igores repeated values. Some of your blog posts may have the same tags (e.g. "learning in public"). But, you want to be able to list all the unique tags, only once each. 

```js title="src/pages/posts/tags/[tag].astro"
  // 2. Create a new `Set` for holding all the tags used on the blog.
  const allTags = new Set();
```

### 3. Add each post’s tags to your new `Set`

Because a `Set` ignores repeated values, you can add safely add every tag from every post to it. For each post, you will go one by one through each of its tags, adding every tag you encounter to your new set. Notice that you are looping within a loop!

```js title="src/pages/posts/tags/[tag].astro"
  // 3. Loop through all the Markdown files, and add any tags found to the Set of tags.
  allPosts.forEach((post) => {
    post.frontmatter.tags.forEach((tag) => allTags.add(tag));
  });
```

You now have a Set `allTags` with element items `"astro"`, `"successes"`, `"community"`, `"blogging"`, `"setbacks"`, `"learning in public"` 

### 4. Convert your `Set` of unique tags into an array

You used a `Set` in the previous steps to make sure you didn't have any duplicated values. But, an array is useful for mapping through and using those items.

```js title="src/pages/posts/tags/[tag].astro"
  // 4. Turn your Set of tags into an array you can map through.
  let uniqueTags = Array.from(allTags);
```

You now have an array `uniqueTags` with element items `"astro"`, `"successes"`, `"community"`, `"blogging"`, `"setbacks"`, `"learning in public"` 

### 5. Define the `return` value of the `getStaticPaths` function

A `getStaticPaths` function should always return a list of objects containing `params` (what you should call each page route) and optionally any `props` (data that you want passed to those pages). This is exactly what you did earlier in this lesson, defining each tag name that you knew was used in your blog and passing the entire list of posts as props to each page.

We still want each tag name to become a page on your website. But now, instead of listing out individually each page route to be built, you will generate this list of tags automatically from your `uniqueTags` array. This means, you don't have to know ahead of time which tags are used on your site. And, you can add new posts with new tags and not update any code. The JavaScript above will automatically find all your tags!

And, you really want each of those page routes to "know about" only the blog posts that include that tag. So you will also filter the list of all blog posts before sending to each page as props.

Replace the final section of pseudocode with the code below:

```js title="src/pages/posts/tags/[tag].astro"
  // 5. For each tag, filter for the blog posts that include it, then return
  //    the name of the tag (for defining the parameters your page route)
  //    an array of posts that include the tag (to be passed as props).
  return uniqueTags.map((tag) => {
    const taggedPosts = allPosts.filter((post) => post.frontmatter.tags.includes(tag));
    return {
      params: { tag },
      props: { posts: taggedPosts },
    };
  });
```

## Final code sample

To check your work, or if you just want complete, correct code to copy into `[tag].astro`, here is what your Astro component should look like:

```astro title="src/pages/posts/tags/[tag].astro"
---
import BaseLayout from '../../layouts/BaseLayout.astro';
import BlogPost from '../../components/BlogPost.astro'

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const allPosts = await Astro.glob('../posts/*.md');
  const allTags = new Set();
  
  allPosts.forEach((post) => {
    post.frontmatter.tags.forEach((tag) => allTags.add(tag));
  });
  
  const uniqueTags = Array.from(allTags);

  return uniqueTags.map((tag) => {
    const taggedPosts = allPosts.filter((post) => post.frontmatter.tags.includes(tag));
    return {
      params: { tag },
      props: { posts: taggedPosts },
    };
  });
}

const { posts } = Astro.props;
const { tag } = Astro.params;

let title = tag; 
---
<BaseLayout title={title}>
  <p>Posts tagged with {title}</p>
  <ul>
    {posts.map((post) => <BlogPost url={post.url} title={post.frontmatter.title}/>)}
  </ul>
</BaseLayout>
```

Now, you should be able to visit any of your tag pages in your browser preview! 

Navigate to `localhost:3000/tags/community` and you should see a list of only your blog posts with the tag `community`. Similarly `localhost:3000/tags/learn%20in%20public` should display a list of the blog posts tagged `learning in public`.

In the next section, you will use `Astro.glob()` again to build a static page that will show a list of every tag, with each one each linking to its own individual page.
