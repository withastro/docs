Now that you have a layout for your pages, let's add a layout for blog posts!

<PreCheck>
  - [Create a new blog post layout for your Markdown files]()
  - [Pass YAML frontmatter values as props to layout component]()
</PreCheck>

## Pass frontmatter properties to a layout

When you include the `layout` frontmatter property in an `.md` file, all of your frontmatter YAML values are available to the layout file.

1. Create a new file at `src/layouts/MarkdownPostLayout.astro`

2. Copy the following code into `MarkdownPostLayout.astro`

    ```astro title="src/layouts/MarkdownPostLayout.astro"
    ---
    const { frontmatter } = Astro.props
    ---
    <h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>
    <p>Written by {frontmatter.author}</p>
    <slot />
    ```

3. Add the following frontmatter property in `post-1.md`

    ```markdown title="src/pages/posts/post-1.md" ins={2}
    ---
    layout: ../../layouts/MarkdownPostLayout.astro
    title: 'My First Blog Post'
    pubDate: 2022-07-01
    description: 'This is the first post of my new Astro blog.'
    author: 'Astro Learner'
    image:
        url: 'https://astro.build/assets/blog/astro-1-release-update/cover.jpeg' 
        alt: 'The Astro logo with the word One.'
    tags: ["astro", "blogging", "learning in public"]
    ---
    ```

4. Check your browser preview again at `localhost:3000/posts/post-1` and notice what the layout has added to your page. 

5. Add the same layout property to your two other blog posts `post-2.md` and `post-3.md`. Verify in your browser that your layout is also applied to these posts.

### Analyze the pattern

1. Which content is now duplicated when you check your blog post in your browser preview? 

    || The title of the page appears twice. ||

2. What are the two different ways that duplicate content is being displayed on the page?

    - || The title written inside the Markdown content is injected into the layout `<slot />` ||

    - || The title is written as props received by the layout component. ||

3. What change should be made to the existing code to remove this duplication?

    || Delete the line `# My First Blog Post` from the page Markdown. ||

4. Although you could remove the duplication another way, why is the answer above the better choice?

    || Keeping the page title being passed by the frontmatter means that you don't have to type the title of the blog post in every Markdown file. It will also allow you to style the title independently. If the title is only displayed from the Markdown heading, then it is only available to the layout as `<slot />` content, which is less flexible. ||
    
    :::tip
    Remember to visually inspect your page preview, to avoid duplicated elements.

## Try it yourself - Customize your blog post layout

**Challenge**: Identify items common to every blog post, and use `MarkdownPostLayout.astro` to render them, instead of writing them in your Markdown in `post-1.md` and in every future blog post.

Here's an example of refactoring your code to include the `pubDate` in the layout component instead of writing it in the body of your Markdown:

```markdown title="src/pages/posts/post-1.md" del={1}
Published on: 2022-07-01

Welcome to my new blog about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.
```

```astro title="src/layouts/MarkdownPostLayout.astro" ins={5}
---
const { frontmatter } = Astro.props
---
<h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>
<p>Published on: {frontmatter.pubDate.slice(0,10)}</p>
<p>Written by {frontmatter.author}</p>
<slot />
<p><a href="/">Home</a></p>
```

Refactor as much as you think is useful to you, and add as much to your layout as you want, remembering that everything that you add to your layout is one less thing you will write in each and every blog post!

Here is an example of a refactored layout that leaves only individual blog post content rendered by the slot. Feel free to use this, or create your own! 

```astro title="src/layouts/MarkdownPostLayout.astro"
---
const { frontmatter } = Astro.props
---
<h1> {frontmatter.title}</h1>
<p>{frontmatter.pubDate.slice(0,10)}</p>
<p><em>{frontmatter.description}</em></p>
<p>Written by: {frontmatter.author}</p>
<img src={frontmatter.image.url} width="300" alt={frontmatter.image.alt} />
<slot />
```
</Box>

:::note[avoid duplication]
 Anything rendered by your layout does **not** need to be typed into your blog post! If you notice any duplication when you check your browser preview, then be sure to remove content from your Markdown file.

 ## Before you go

### Test your knowledge
Fill in the blanks so that the following two components together produce working Astro code:

1.  ```markdown title="src/pages/posts/learning-astro.md"
    ---
    layout: ../../__________/MyMarkdownLayout.astro
    title: "Learning About Markdown in Astro"
    author: Astro Learner
    ____: 2022-08-08
    ---
    I learned so much today! Astro allows me to write in Markdown, but also use variables from the frontmatter. I can even even access those values in an Astro layout component.
    ```

2.  ```astro title="src/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro"
    ---
    import ____________ from '../components/Footer.astro'
    const { ___________ } = Astro.props
    ---
    <h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>
    <p>Written by:{frontmatter.______ } on {frontmatter.pubDate}</p>
    < _______ />
    <Footer />
    ```
</Box>

### Checklist for moving on

<Checklist key="frontmatter">
- [ ] I can add metadata to a blog post by creating a property in its YAML frontmatter.
- [ ] I can create a separate layout for Markdown posts that renders the file's Markdown content in a `<slot />`.
- [ ] I can use values from a blog post's frontmatter in its layout component.
</Checklist>
