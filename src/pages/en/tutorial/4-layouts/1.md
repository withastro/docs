  - Refactor common elements into a page layout
  - Use an Astro `<slot />` element to place page contents within a layout
  - Pass page-specific values as props to its layout
</PreCheck>

You still have some Astro components repeatedly rendered on every page. Let's refactor again to create a shared page layout!

## Create your first layout component

1. Create a new file at the location `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`. (You will need to create a new `layouts` folder first.)

2. Copy the **entire contents** of `index.astro` into your new file, `BaseLayout.astro`.

    ```astro title="src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro"
    ---
    const pageTitle = "Home Page";
    import Header from '../components/Header.astro';
    import Footer from '../components/Footer.astro';
    import '../styles/global.css';
    ---
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
        <meta name="generator" content={Astro.generator} />
        <title>{pageTitle}</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <Header />
        <h1>{pageTitle}</h1>
        <Footer />
        <script>
          import "../scripts/menu.js";
        </script>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

## Use your layout on a page

3. Replace the code at `src/pages/index.astro` with the following:

    ```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
    ---
    import BaseLayout from '../layouts/BaseLayout.astro';
    const pageTitle = "Home Page";
    ---
    <BaseLayout>
      <h2>My awesome blog subtitle</h2>
    </BaseLayout>
    ```
 
4. Check the browser preview again to notice what did (or, spoiler alert: did _not_!) change.
    
5. Add a `<slot />` element to `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` just above the footer component, then check the browser preview of your Home page and notice what really _did_ change this time!

    ```astro title="src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro" ins={18}
    ---
    const pageTitle = "Home Page";
    import Header from '../components/Header.astro';
    import Footer from '../components/Footer.astro';
    import '../styles/global.css';
    ---
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
        <meta name="generator" content={Astro.generator} />
        <title>{pageTitle}</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <Header />
        <h1>{pageTitle}</h1>
        <slot />
        <Footer />
        <script>
          import "../scripts/menu.js";
        </script>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

### Analyze the pattern

1. What is the purpose of a `<slot />`?

    || A `<slot />` allows you to inject (or "slot in") **child content** to any `Component.astro` file that is written between opening and closing `<Component></Component>` tags ||

2. You can use a `<slot />` in any Astro component to pass data to be rendered, but why is this a particularly useful feature for a layout?

    || This is useful for a layout component in particular because you often want a page layout to define most elements on your page _except_ for some specific page content, that is different on every page. A `<slot />` allows you to create one single, shared page layout, and have different inner content on each page.  ||
</Box>

## Pass page-specific values as props

1. Pass the page title to your layout component from `index.astro` using a component attribute: 

    ```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" 'title={pageTitle}'
    ---
    import BaseLayout from '../layouts/BaseLayout.astro';
    const pageTitle = "Home Page";
    ---
    <BaseLayout pageTitle={pageTitle}>
      <h2>My awesome blog subtitle</h2>
    </BaseLayout>
    ```

2. Change the script of your `BaseLayout.astro` layout component to receive a page title via `Astro.props` instead of defining it as a constant.

    ```astro title="src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro" del={4} ins={5}
    ---
    import Navigation from '../components/Navigation.astro';
    import Footer from '../components/Footer.astro';
    const pageTitle = "Home Page";
    const { pageTitle } = Astro.props;
    ---
    ```

3. Check your browser preview to verify that your page title has not changed. It has the same value, but is now being rendered dynamically. And now, each individual page can specify its own title to the layout.

<Box icon="puzzle-piece">

### Analyze the Pattern

1. What are the two ways your `<BaseLayout>` component receives content from `index.astro`?

    || The layout component receives child content written between opening and closing `<BaseLayout>` tags. It also receives a value ("Home Page") through a component attribute written inside the opening `<BaseLayout>` tag. ||

1. When would you choose to give `<BaseLayout>` props instead of only using its own `<slot />` to render child content?

    || Component attributes gives your layout values that you can use wherever you write JavaScript expressions. This is useful for page-specific values like a title that you may wish to include dynamically in multiple places. Content rendered by a `<slot />` is injected as a single chunk of HTML, into one specific location. Its contents are not available as individual pieces. ||

1. What are the two steps required so that a layout component receives a value as a prop?

    || A layout component must be "passed props" where it is written, using a component attribute. The layout itself must also have a line of code written in its own frontmatter script to receive these values as `Astro.props`.||

1. What are the two steps required so that your layout component receives data as children?

    || Any child content to be passed to the layout must be written between opening and closing layout tags. The layout itself must also contain a `<slot />` element to know where to inject the child data.||

## Try it yourself - Use your layout everywhere

**Refactor** your other pages (`blog.astro` and `about.astro`) so that they use your new `<BaseLayout>` component to render the common page elements.

Don't forget to:

- Pass a page title as props via a component attribute.

- Let the layout be responsible for the HTML rendering of any common elements.

- Delete anything from each page that that page is no longer responsible for rendering, because it is being handled by the layout, including: 

  - HTML elements
  - Components and their imports 
  - CSS rules in a `<style>` tag (e.g. `<h1>` in your About page)
  - `<script>` tags

## Before you go

### Test your knowledge

1. An Astro component (`.astro` file) can function as a:

    <MultipleChoice>
      <Option>page</Option>
      <Option>UI component</Option>
      <Option>layout</Option>
      <Option>an image</Option>
      <Option isCorrect>all of the above, because Astro components are so functional! 🏗️</Option>
    </MultipleChoice>

2. To display a page title on the page, you can:

    <MultipleChoice>
      <Option>
        use a standard HTML element on the page with static text (e.g `<h1>Home Page</h1>`)
      </Option>
      <Option>
        use a standard HTML element on the page referring to a variable defined in your component's frontmatter script (e.g. `<h1>{pageTitle}</h1>`)
      </Option>
      <Option>
        use a layout component on the page, passing the title as a component attribute (e.g. `<BaseLayout title="Home Page" />` or `<BaseLayout title={pageTitle} />`)
      </Option>
      <Option isCorrect>
        all of the above, because Astro lets you use plain HTML or supercharge it with some script and components! 💪
      </Option>
    </MultipleChoice>

3. Information can be passed from one component to another by:

    <MultipleChoice>
      <Option>
        importing a UI component and rendering it in the template of another component
      </Option>
      <Option>
        passing props to a component where it is rendered via a component attribute
      </Option>
      <Option>
        sending HTML content to be rendered inside another component using a `<slot />` placeholder
      </Option>
      <Option isCorrect>
        all of the above, because Astro was built to take advantage of component-based design! 🧩
      </Option>
    </MultipleChoice>

</Box>

### Checklist for moving on

<Checklist>
- [ ] I can create an Astro component with a `<slot />` that serves as a page layout.
- [ ] I can send page-specific properties to a layout using a component attribute.
- [ ] I can render page content inside a layout by "wrapping" my entire page HTML template in opening and closing layout component tags.
</Checklist>
