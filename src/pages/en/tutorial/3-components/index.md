Now that you have multiple `.astro` files generating pages on your website, let's explore Astro's **component-based design** in this module to make and reuse smaller bits of HTML!

<Goals>
  - created reusable Astro components for UI items on your website (e.g. Header, Footer)
  - used standard HTML elements alongside Astro components in the same template
  - sent data from one Astro component to another passing `props` as a component attribute
  - sent data from one Astro component to another using a `<slot />`
  - created a layout template that can be used to display identical elements on multiple pages
</Goals>

The building blocks of an Astro site are **components**. Astro components are `.astro` files and they generate static HTML. An Astro component can generate the all the HTML needed for an entire web page, like your existing `index.astro`, `about.astro`, and `blog.astro` files. Or, they can produce smaller units of HTML that can be included inside other Astro components.

**Component-based design** is the practice of building your web page as a collection of modular, often reusable, pieces. Astro components are meant to be building-blocks that can fit within, and alongside other components. In fact, your existing Astro pages are just Astro components that happen to display an entire page's worth of HTML!

### Test your knowledge

Which of the following could be an Astro component?

<MultipleChoice>
  <Option>your website's navigation bar</Option>
  <Option>a feedback widget</Option>
  <Option>your About page</Option>
  <Option>an image</Option>
  <Option isCorrect>all of the above, because *any* valid unit of HTML can be generated by an Astro component!</Option>
</MultipleChoice>
