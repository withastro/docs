Now that you have a styled About page, let's add some global styles for the rest of your site!

## Add a global stylesheet

You have seen that the Astro `<style>` tag is **scoped by default**, meaning that it only affects the elements in its own file.

There are a few ways to define styles **globally** in Astro, but in this tutorial, you will create and import a `global.css` file into each of your pages. This combination of stylesheet and `<style>` tag gives you the ability to control some styles site-wide, and to apply some specific styles exactly where you want them.

1. Create a new file at the location `src/styles/global.css` (You'll have to create a `styles` folder first.)

2. Copy the following code into your new file, `global.css`

    ```css title="src/styles/global.css"
    html {
      background-color: #00539F;
    }
    body {
      background-color: #E2CAF1;
      margin: 0 auto;
      width: 80%;
      max-width: 80ch;
      padding: 1em;
      border: 5px solid black;
    }

    h1 {
      margin: 0;
      padding: 20px 0;
      color: #00539F;
      text-shadow: 3px 3px 1px grey;
    }
    ```
3. In `about.astro`, add the following import statement anywhere in your frontmatter: 

    ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro" ins={22}
    ---
    const pageTitle = "About Me"

    const identity = {
      firstName: "Sarah",
      country: "Canada",
      occupation: "Technical Writer",
      hobbies: ["photography", "birdwatching", "baseball"],
    }

    const skills = ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", "React", "Astro", "Writing Docs"]

    const happy = true
    const finished = false
    const goal = 3

    const skillColor = "green"
    const fontWeight = "bold"
    const textCase = "uppercase"
    const bulletStyle = "'*'"

    import '../styles/global.css'
    ---
    ```

4. Check the browser preview of your About page, and you should now see new styles applied!

## Try it yourself - Import your global stylesheet

Add the necessary line of code to each `.astro` file in your project to apply your global styles to every page of your site.

<details>
<summary>✅ Show me the code! ✅</summary>

Add the following import statement to the two other page files: `src/pages/index.astro` and `src/pages/blog.astro`

```astro
---
// src/pages/index.astro
import '../styles/global.css'
---
```
</details>
</Box>

Make any changes or additions you want to the content of your About page by adding HTML elements to the page template, either statically or dynamically. Write any additional JavaScript in your frontmatter script to provide you with values to use in your HTML. When you are happy with this page, commit your changes to GitHub before moving on to the next lesson.

### Analyze the Pattern

Your About page is now styled using *both* the imported `global.css` file *and* a `<style>` tag.

- Are styles from both styling methods being applied? 

    || Yes ||

- Are there any conflicting styles, and if so, which are applied?

    || Yes, `h1` is defined as blue globally, but purple locally in the `<style>` tag. The purple color is applied.  ||

- Describe how `global.css` and `<style>` work together.

    || When conflicting styles are defined both globally and in a page's local `<script>` tag, the local styles should overwrite any global styles. (But, there can be other factors involved, so always visually inspect your site to make sure your styles are properly applied!)  ||

- How would you choose whether to declare a style in a `global.css` file or a `<style>` tag?

    || If you want a style to be applied site-wide, you would choose to use a `global.css` file. However, if you want styles to apply to only the HTML content in a single `.astro` file, and not affect other elements on your site, you would choose a `<style>` tag. ||

### Checklist for moving on

<Checklist>
- [ ] I can define global CSS styles in a `.css` file located elsewhere in my project, and I understand how they work with local `<style>` tags.
</Checklist>
