title: Using Astro Script
---

## Goals

BY THE END OF THIS SECTION YOU WILL HAVE:
- defined variables in your `about.astro` file's script and then used them in its HTML template
- rendered a combination of static and dynamic content on your About page
- used values defined in script to conditionally render HTML elements on your About page

Now that you have a multi-page website with HTML content, let's add some **Astro Script**!

## Summary

Any HTML file is valid Astro language. You can write any text inside HTML elements and Astro will render that **static** (unchanging) content to the page. But, you can do more with Astro than just regular HTML!

We will use the top part of our `.astro` file, the component script, to add **dynamic** content to our page. This is content that depends on and is determined by **values defined elsewhere**, not static text typed directly into your element.

## Rendering using Script 

Here you will edit the script content to use a variable in your HTML

### Define and use a variable

Open `about.astro` which should look like this:

```astro
---

---
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset ="utf-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
        <title>Astro</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <a href="/">Home</blog>
        <a href="/about">About</blog>
        <a href="/blog">Blog</blog>
        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

        <p>I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!</p>

        <p>This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking back and see how my journey is going!</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

1. Add the following line of JavaScript to your Astro script (at the top of your file, between the **code fences**):
```astro
---
const pageTitle = "About Me"
---
```
2. Replace the static "About Me" heading in the body of your HTML with the dynamic variable `{pageTitle}`.

```diff
- <h1>About Me</h1>
+ <h1>{pageTitle}</h1>
```

3. Check the live preview of your `/about` page
Your site should look the same! 

Instead of typing text directly into HTML tags, you just **defined and used a variable** in the two sections of your `.astro` file, respectively.

> **Define** variables in your Astro script using JavaScript or TypeScript expressions.
>
>
> **Use** these variables in your Astro template inside curly braces { } to tell Astro you're using some script.

> Astro script syntax is similar to JSX syntax. If you're ever wondering how to use your script, then searching for how it is done in JSX is probably a good starting point!


### Script expressions

1. Add the following lines to your component script to **define variables**:
```astro
---
const goal = 3
const time = "days"
const happy = true
const finished = false
---
```
2. Then, add the following Astro syntax using these variables to your component template, below your existing `<p>` tags:
```astro
<p>I want to finish this tutorial in {goal} {time}.</p> 
<p>But, it's ok if it takes me twice as long, and I finish in {goal*2}!</p>
```
3. Check the site preview in your browser, and you should now see these two new sentences appear:

I want to finish this tutorial in 3 days.

But, it's ok if it takes me twice as long, and I finish in 6!

#### Analyze the patterns
1. How do you **define a value** for use inside an Astro component?

|| _use a `const` statement in the component script, between the code fences_ ||

2. Which pair of symbols tells Astro that you want to **use script** instead of plain text inside your HTML elements?

|| _curly braces_ ||

### Conditional Rendering

You can also use your script variables to choose **whether or not** to render individual elements of your HTML `<body>` content:

Add the following lines of Astro within the `<body></body>` tags of `about.astro`, below your existing paragraphs.

Then, check the live preview in your browser tab to see what is **rendered** to the page:

```astro
{happy && <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>}

{finished && <p>I finished this tutorial!</p>}

{goal === 3 ? <p>My goal is 3 days.</p> : <p>My goal is not 3 days.</p>}
```

> Note with reference about using JavaScript expressions and operators, especially calling out ternaries

## Before you go

Commit your changes to GitHub before moving on, and feel free to do so any time you want to save your work and update your live website!

### Test your knowledge:
Given the following `.astro` script:
```astro
---
operatingSystem = "Linux"
quantity = 3
clothing = "shoes"
student = false
---
```

1. For each Astro template expression, write out in words the HTML output that will be rendered in the browser:
```astro
a. <p>{operatingSytem}</p> // <p>Linux</p>

b. {student && <p>I am still in school.</p>} // (nothing!)

c. <p>I have {quantity+8} pairs of {clothing}</p> // <p>I have 11 pairs of shoes</p>

d. {operatingSystem === "MacOS" ? <p>I am using a Mac.</p> : <p>I am not using a Mac.</p>} // <p>I am not using a Mac.</p>
```
### Checklist for moving on:
[ ] I can define values in my Astro script and render these values in HTML elements.

[ ] I can conditionally render entire HTML elements using JavaScript expressions and logical operators.
