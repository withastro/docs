## Store your repository on GitHub

:::tip[using stackblitz]
If you have forked an Astro starter template on StackBlitz, you will be able to create a GitHub repository right from your project workspace, without visiting GitHub.com.

Press the <kbd>Connect Repository</kbd> button at the top of your list of files, enter a new name for your repository, and click <kbd>Create repo & push</kbd>. 

When you have changes to be committed back to GitHub, a "Commit" button will appear at the top left of your workspace. Clicking on this will allow you to enter a commit message, and update your repository.

SKip ahead to ["Deploy your Website on Netlify"](#deploy-your-website-on-netlify) to connect your GitHub repository and publish your site to the web.

### Create a repository on GitHub

Although there are a few ways to get your local code stored in GitHub, this tutorial will guide you through a method that does not require using git in the command line. 

:::note
If you are already familiar with git, and have your own workflow, then create a new GitHub repository for your project using your preferred method. Skip ahead to ["Deploy your Website on Netlify"](#deploy-your-website-on-netlify)
:::

1. Log in to GitHub.com in a browser and click the <kbd>+</kbd> in the upper right of the screen to make a new repository. 

2. Choose a name for your repository. This does not have to be the same name as your project folder.

3. You will be presented with options, but you do not need to change any of the defaults. Scroll down and click the button to <kbd>Create Repository</kbd>.

4. You will be presented with various setup next steps, but you won't need to use any of them. You can now exit this page without doing anything.


### Commit your code to GitHub

In the last section, you made a change to your page's content. This means that your project files have changed, and VS Code should show a number on top of the "Source" menu icon. This source tab is where you will reguarly go to update your files on GitHub.

1. Click the Source Control tab in your VS Code to see a list of files that have changed. 

2. Click the <kbd>•••</kbd> "3 dots" menu above the commit message and choose <kbd>Remote</kbd> > <kbd>Add Remote</kbd>.

3. Select <kbd>Add remote from GitHub</kbd>. (You may need to authorize the GitHub extension to log in to GitHub and see your repositories. Follow the steps to allow this, then return to VS Code.)

4. You should see a list of all your repositories on GitHub. Choose the one you created for this project. You may also be asked to give this repository a local name. You can select any name you like.

5. At the top of the menu pane, there will be a place to enter a **commit message** (description of your file changes). Type in `initial commit to GitHub` and press the <kbd>Commit</kbd> button to commit these changes.

7. You may see a message telling you that you have no "staged" commits, and asking you if you want to stage them. Click <kbd>Always</kbd> and continue.

8. Lastly, the list of changed files should be replaced with a <kbd>Publish</kbd> button. Click this to send your committed changes to GitHub.


#### See your project on GitHub

To verify that your project is successfully stored on GitHub, visit GitHub.com again in a browser window and look under your account for a list of your repositories. Choose the new one you created, and verify that it contains your Astro project files.

## Deploy your website on Netlify

Here, you will connect your GitHub repository to Netlify. Netlify will use that project to create a live, public website. 

### Create a new Netlify site

1. Log in to https://app.netlify.com/.

2. Click <kbd>Add new site</kbd> > <kbd>Import an existing project</kbd>.

    You will be asked to connect to a Git provider. Choose GitHub and follow the steps onscreen to authenticate your GitHub account. Then, choose your Astro project's GitHub repository from the list provided.

3. At the final step, Netlify will show you your app's site settings. The defaults should be correct for your Astro project, so you can scroll down and click <kbd>Deploy site</kbd>.

Congratulations, you have an Astro website!

### Change your project name

On your site's overview page in Netlify, you will see your randomly-generated project name, and your website URL of the form `https://project-name-123456.netlify.app`. You can change your project name to something more memorable, and this will automatically update your URL.

### Visit your new website

Click on the URL in your site settings, or type it in to a browser window to view your new website.
