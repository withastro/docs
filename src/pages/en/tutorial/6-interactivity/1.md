<PreCheck>

  - add Preact to your Astro project
  - include `.jsx` components on your home page
  - use different `client:` directives to customize the JavaScript hydration of your islands

</PreCheck>

## Add Preact to your Astro project

1. Quit the dev server (<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>) to have access to the terminal. Then, add the ability to use Preact components in your Astro project with a single command:

    ```shell
    npx astro add preact
    ```

2. Follow the command line instructions to confirm adding Preact to your project.
 

## Preact Greeting Banner

This component will randomly select one of four greetings and use it in a welcome message.

1. Create a new file in `src/components/` named `Greeting.jsx`

    Note the `.jsx` file extension used by Preact. This file will be written in JSX, not Astro syntax.

2. Add the following code to `Greeting.jsx`:

    ```jsx title="src/components/Greeting.jsx"
    import { h } from 'preact'

    export default function Banner({messages}) {
      const greeting = messages[(Math.floor(Math.random() * 4))];
      return (
        <h3>{greeting}! Thank you for visiting!</h3>
      );
    }
    ```

3. Import and use this component on your Home page `index.astro`. Note that `jsx` files are imported without their file extension:

    ```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" ins={3,8}
    ---
    import BaseLayout from '../layouts/BaseLayout.astro';
    import Greeting from '../components/Greeting';
    const pageTitle = "Home Page"
    ---
    <BaseLayout pageTitle={pageTitle}>
      <h2>My awesome blog subtitle</h2>
      <Greeting messages={["Hi", "Hello", "Howdy", "Hey there"]} />
    </BaseLayout>
    ```

4. Add a second `<Greeting />` component with the `client:load` directive.

      ```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" ins={9} "client:load"
    ---
    import BaseLayout from '../layouts/BaseLayout.astro';
    import Greeting from '../components/Greeting';
    const pageTitle = "Home Page"
    ---
    <BaseLayout pageTitle={pageTitle}>
      <h2>My awesome blog subtitle</h2>
      <Greeting messages={["Hi", "Hello", "Howdy", "Hey there"]} />
      <Greeting client:load messages={["Hej", "Hallo", "Hola", "Habari"]} />
    </BaseLayout>
    ```

### Build your site

To see the difference in client-side behavior between these components, you will need to view your built site. 

1. To view your built site locally, quit the dev server and run the following two commands to first, build your site to a local folder and then, run the preview of that build.

    ```sh
    npm run build

    npm run preview
    ```
  :::tip
  You can also check your build site by committing your current progress to GitHub, and waiting for Netlify to automatically build and republish your site to the web.
  ::: 

2. Refresh the page several times and compare the behavior of the two greeting messages, noticing whether they do or do not update. 

  Don't forget to restart the dev server before continuing if you are previewing your build locally!

    
### Analyze the Pattern

Consider an Astro component with the following code:

```astro
---
import BaseLayout from '../layouts/BaseLayout.astro';
import AstroBanner from '../components/AstroBanner.astro';
import PreactBanner from '../components/PreactBanner';
import SvelteCounter from '../components/SvelteCounter.svelte';
---
<BaseLayout>
  <AstroBanner />
  <PreactBanner />
  <PreactBanner client:load />
  <SvelteCounter />
  <SvelteCounter client:visible />
</BaseLayout>
```

1. Which of the five components will be **hydrated islands**, sending JavaScript to the client to run even after the site has been built?

    || `<PreactBanner client:load />` and `<SvelteCounter client:visible />` will be hydrated islands. ||

2. In what way(s) will the two `<PreactBanner />` components be the same? In what way(s) will they be different? 

    || Same: They both render the same HTML elements and look the same. Different: One will be generated at build time and will not rerender until your site is rebuilt. It will look the same until your site is rebuilt. The one with a client directive will execute its JavaScript on every page refresh, showing an updated component. ||

3. If you couldn't see your website's code, only the live published page, how would you tell which `<SvelteCounter />` component used `client:visible`? 

    || Try clicking the buttons, and see which one is interactive. The one that is interactive has a client directive, because its JavaScript to increase and decrease the counter in response to button clicks has been sent to the client. ||

## Before you go

### Test your knowledge

For each of the following components, identify what will be sent to the browser:

1. `<ReactCounter client:load/>`

    <MultipleChoice>
      <Option>
        HTML and CSS only
      </Option>
      <Option isCorrect>
        HTML, CSS and JavaScript
      </Option>
    </MultipleChoice>

2. `<SvelteCard />`

    <MultipleChoice>
      <Option  isCorrect>
        HTML and CSS only
      </Option>
      <Option>
        HTML, CSS and JavaScript
      </Option>
    </MultipleChoice>


### Checklist for moving on

<Checklist key="framework">
- [ ] I can install an Astro integration using the command `astro add` in the terminal.
- [ ] I can write UI framework components in their own language, with their own native extention, then import and use them in `.astro` components alongside my Astro components.
- [ ] I can choose whether to use a `client:directive` to control hydration on my UI framework component, depending on when I want its JavaScript to run.
</Checklist>
