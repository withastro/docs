## Goals

BY THE END OF THIS SECTION, YOU WILL:
- know what background programming language/info you will need to get started building with Astro
- have chosen and installed any tools that you will use to build your Astro website
- have the necessary online accounts to host and deploy your site to the web, if desired.

## Pre-Requisites

This tutorial is designed to be accessible to new web developers, as well as devs who are simply new to Astro. It assumes some basic familiarity with **HTML**, **Markdown**, **CSS**, and a little **JavaScript**. But, you will be able to learn a lot of what you need to know during the tutorial itself!

TODO: Visit free resources like FreeCodeCamp.org for full courses or quick refreshers in HTML, CSS, JS and more!

## Development Tools

### Terminal

You will use the **command line (terminal)** to create your Astro project and to run key commands to build, develop, and test your site. You can access the command line through a local terminal program for your operating system. Common applications include: Terminal (MacOS/Linux), Command Prompt (Windows), Termux (Android) and one of these will probably already be on your machine. 

You will also need to have **Node.js** installed, which you can do via the command line. 

### Code Editor

Additionally, you will need to download and install a **code editor** to write your code. We will use VS Code in this tutorial, but you can use any editor for your operating system.

>You can also complete this tutorial using a web browser instead of installing any local software! You can access both the command line and a code editor together in a cloud development environment like StackBlitz, CodeSandbox or Gitpod.


TODO: [Download and install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads) or another code editor of your choice. Then, launch the terminal app on your machine and [install Node.js (v.14.15.0 or v16.0.0 or higher)](docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) via the command line.
> OR Create an account at StackBlitz or CodeSandbox. Then, visit [astro.new](https://astro.new) and click to open the "Completely Empty" project in the editor of your choice. After signing in, "fork" the project to save it to your own account.

### Source Control

Many software projects use a version control system to track changes in your project over time. In this tutorial, you will use a free **online git provider** (GitHub), and will not need to know how to use git commands in the terminal. All git actions in this tutorial will be performed through menu items in your code editor and will sync your **repository** (files and version history) to the cloud. This tutorial will use GitHub for online source control, but you are welcome to use your preferred online git provider.

### Continuous Build and Deployment
Once your project is stored online, you will connect your repository to a free **web host** (Netlify) to build and deploy your site live on the web every time you commit a change to your code. This tutorial will use Netlify, but you are welcome to use your preferred hosting service for deploying your site to the internet.

TODO: Create a free account at [GitHub](https://github.com) (or your preferred cloud git provider) and a free account at [Netlify](https://netlify.com) (or your preferred hosting service).
