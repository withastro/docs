Customize your code editor to improve the Astro developer experience and unlock new features.

## VS Code

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a popular code editor for web developers, built by Microsoft. The VS Code engine also powers popular in-browser code editors like [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) and [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/).

Astro works with any code editor. However, VS Code is our recommended editor for Astro projects. We maintain an official [Astro VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astro-build.astro-vscode) that unlocks several key features and developer experience improvements for Astro projects.

- Syntax highlighting for `.astro` files.
- TypeScript type information for `.astro` files.
- [VS Code Intellisense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense) for code completion, hints and more.

To get started, install the [Astro VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astro-build.astro-vscode) today.

import ReadMore from '~/components/ReadMore.astro';

## JetBrains IDEs

[Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) is a JavaScript and TypeScript IDE that added support for the Astro Language Server in version 2024.2. This update brings features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and formatting.

## Other tools

### ESLint

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a popular linter for JavaScript and JSX. For Astro support, [a community maintained plugin](https://github.com/ota-meshi/eslint-plugin-astro) can be installed.

See [the project's User Guide](https://ota-meshi.github.io/eslint-plugin-astro/user-guide/) for more information on how to install and set up ESLint for your project.

### Stylelint

[Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) is a popular linter for CSS. [A community maintained Stylelint configuration](https://github.com/ota-meshi/stylelint-config-html) provides Astro support.

Installation instructions, editor integration, and additional information can be found in the project's README.

### Prettier

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is a popular formatter for JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and more. If you're using the [Astro VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astro-build.astro-vscode) or [the Astro language server within another editor](#other-code-editors), code formatting with Prettier is included.

To add support for formatting `.astro` files outside of the editor (e.g. CLI) or inside editors that don't support our editor tooling, install [the official Astro Prettier plugin](https://github.com/withastro/prettier-plugin-astro).

<Steps>
1. Install `prettier` and `prettier-plugin-astro`.

    <PackageManagerTabs>
      <Fragment slot="npm">
      ```shell
      npm install --save-dev prettier prettier-plugin-astro
      ```
      </Fragment>
      <Fragment slot="pnpm">
      ```shell
      pnpm add -D prettier prettier-plugin-astro
      ```
      </Fragment>
      <Fragment slot="yarn">
      ```shell
      yarn add --dev prettier prettier-plugin-astro
      ```
      </Fragment>
    </PackageManagerTabs>

2. Create a `.prettierrc.mjs` config file at the root of your project and add `prettier-plugin-astro` to it.

    In this file, also manually specify the parser for Astro files.

    ```js title=".prettierrc.mjs"
    /** @type {import("prettier").Config} */
    export default {
      plugins: ['prettier-plugin-astro'],
      overrides: [
        {
          files: '*.astro',
          options: {
            parser: 'astro',
          },
        },
      ],
    };
    ```

3. Run the command `prettier . --write` in the terminal to format your files.

    <PackageManagerTabs>
      <Fragment slot="npm">
      ```shell
      npx prettier . --write
      ```
      </Fragment>
      <Fragment slot="pnpm">
      ```shell
      pnpm exec prettier . --write
      ```
      </Fragment>
      <Fragment slot="yarn">
      ```shell
      yarn prettier . --write
      ```
      </Fragment>
    </PackageManagerTabs>
</Steps>

See the [Prettier plugin's README](https://github.com/withastro/prettier-plugin-astro/blob/main/README.md) for more information about its supported options, how to set up Prettier inside VS Code, and more.
