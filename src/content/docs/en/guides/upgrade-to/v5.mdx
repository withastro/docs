## Astro v5.0 Experimental Flags Removed

The following features are no longer experimental in Astro v5.0:

- [`env`]()
- [`serverIslands`]()
- [`contentLayer`]()

Additionally, the following experimental flags have been removed and **are now the default behavior in Astro v5.0**. 

- `directRenderScript`
- `globalRoutePriority`

Please see below for breaking changes to [default `<script>` behavior]() and [default route priority order]()

Remove these experimental flags if you were previously using them, and move your `env` configuration to the root of your Astro config:

```js del={5-11} ins={13-15} title="astro.config.mjs"
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  experimental: {
    directRenderScript: true,
    globalRoutePriority: true,
    contentLayer: true,
    serverIslands: true,
    env: {
      schema: {...}
    }
  },
  env: {
      schema: {...}
  }
})
```

These features are all available by default in Astro v5.0. Only `astro:env` requires any configuration to use.

Read about these exciting features and more in [the v5.0-beta Blog post](https://astro.build/blog/astro-4/). * UPDATE LINK


## Upgrades

### Node Support

The minimum supported version of Node.js in Astro v5.0 is `v18.17.1`

#### What should I do?

 Check that both your development environment and your deployment environment are using **Node `18.17.1` or higher**.

<Steps>
1. Check your local version of Node using:

    ```sh
    node -v
    ```

2. Check your [deployment environment's](/en/guides/deploy/) own documentation to verify that they support this version of Node.

    You can specify Node `18.17.1` for your Astro project either in a dashboard configuration setting or a `.nvmrc` file.

    ```bash title=".nvmrc"
    18.17.1
    ```
</Steps>

{/*
// THESE ARE FOR DEPENDENCY UPGRADES

Any major upgrades to Astro's dependencies may cause breaking changes in your project.

### Upgraded: Vite 5.0

Placeholder

#### What should I do?

If you are using Vite-specific plugins, configuration, or APIs, check the [Vite migration guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/migration) for their breaking changes and upgrade your project as needed. There are no breaking changes to Astro itself.

*/}

## Breaking Changes

The following changes are considered breaking changes in Astro v5.0. Breaking changes may or may not provide temporary backwards compatibility.

{/* If you need to refer to the documentation for a v4.x project, you can browse this [(unmaintained) snapshot of the docs from before v5.0 was released](https://docs-git-v3-docs-unmaintained-astrodotbuild.vercel.app/). */}

### Removed: some public-facing types (PLT844 - alpha.0)

<SourcePR number="11715" title="Refactor/types"/>

In Astro v4.x, `@types/astro.ts` exposed all types publicly to users, whether or not they were still actively used or only intended for internal use.

Astro v5.0 refactors this file to [remove outdated and internal types](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/11715). This refactor brings improvements to your editor (e.g. faster completions, lower memory use, more relevant completion options). However, this refactor may cause errors in some projects that have been relying on types that are no longer available to the public.

#### What should I do?

Remove any types that now cause errors in your project as you no longer have access to them. These will be mostly previously deprecated and removed APIs, but may also include types that are now internal.

### Changed: Correctly render non-boolean HTML attribute values (PLT2279 - alpha.0)

<SourcePR number="11660" title="Fix attribute rendering for boolean values (take 2)"/>

In Astro v4.x, non-[boolean HTML attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Boolean/HTML) may not have included their values when rendered to HTML.

Astro v5.0 renders the values explicitly as `="true"` or `="false"`, matching proper attribute handling in browsers.

In the following `.astro` examples, only `allowfullscreen` is a boolean attribute:

```astro
<!-- src/pages/index.astro -->
<!-- `allowfullscreen` is a boolean attribute -->
<p allowfullscreen={true}></p>
<p allowfullscreen={false}></p>
<!-- `inherit` is *not* a boolean attribute -->
<p inherit={true}></p>
<p inherit={false}></p>
<!-- `data-*` attributes are not boolean attributes -->
<p data-light={true}></p>
<p data-light={false}></p>
```

Astro v5.0 now preserves the full data attribute with its value when rendering the HTML of non-boolean attributes:

```diff lang="astro"
  <p allowfullscreen></p>
  <p></p>

  <p inherit="true"></p>
- <p inherit></p>
+ <p inherit="false"></p>

- <p data-light></p>
+ <p data-light="true"></p>
- <p></p>
+ <p data-light="false"></p>
```

#### What should I do?

If you rely on attribute values, for example to locate elements or to conditionally render, update your code to match the new non-boolean attribute values:

```diff lang="js"
- el.getAttribute('inherit') === ''
+ el.getAttribute('inherit') === 'false'

- el.hasAttribute('data-light')
+ el.dataset.light === 'true'
```

### Changed: Shiki `css-variables` theme color token names (PLT1626 - alpha.0)

<SourcePR number="11661" title="Update to new shiki token names"/>

In Astro v4.x, the Shiki `css-variables` theme uses the `--astro-code-color-text` and `--astro-code-color-background` tokens for styling the foreground and background colors of code blocks respectively.

Astro v5.0 renames them to `--astro-code-foreground` and `--astro-code-background` tokens respectively to better align with the Shiki v1 defaults.

#### What should I do?

You can perform a global find and replace in your project to migrate to the new token names.

```diff lang="css"
:root {
-  --astro-code-color-text: #000;
-  --astro-code-color-background: #fff;
+  --astro-code-foreground: #000;
+  --astro-code-background: #fff;
}
```

### Changed: CSRF protection is now set by default (PLT2262 - alpha.1)

<SourcePR number="11788" title="change default value of checkOrigin"/>

In Astro v4.x, The default value of `security.checkOrigin` was `false`. Previously, you had to explicitly set this value to `true` to enable Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.

Astro v5.0 changes the default value  of this option to `true`, and will automatically check that the "origin" header matches the URL sent by each request in on-demand rendered pages.

#### What should I do?

If you had previously configured `security.checkOrigin: true`, you no longer need this line in your Astro config. This is now the default.

To disable this behaviour, you must explicitly set  `security.checkOrigin: false`.

```js title="astro.config.mjs" del={3-5}
export default defineConfig({
  output: "server",
  security: {
    checkOrigin: true
  }
})
```

### Removed: top level await in `vite-plugin-markdown`'s `astro:assets` (PLT1323 - alpha.1)

<SourcePR number="11782" title="Remove TLA by making compiledContent async"/>

In Astro 4.x, included top level await in Markdown modules. This caused some issues with custom image services and images inside Markdown, causing Node to suddenly exit with no error message.

Astro 5.0 makes the `compiledContent()` property on Markdown imports an async function, requiring an `await` to resolve the content.

#### What should I do?

Update your code to use `await` when calling `compiledContent()`.

```diff lang="astro
---
import * as myPost from "../post.md";

- const content = myPost.compiledContent();
+ const content = await myPost.compiledContent();
---

<Fragment set:html={content} />
```

### Removed: Squoosh image service from core repo (PLT1380 - alpha.1)

<SourcePR number="11770" title="remove the squoosh image service"/>

In Astro 4.x, you could configure `image.service: squooshImageService()` to use Squoosh to transform your images instead of Sharp. However, the underlying library `libsquoosh` is no longer maintained and has memory and performance issues.

Astro 5.0 removes the Squoosh image optimization service entirely.

#### What should I do?

To switch to the built-in Sharp image service, remove the `squooshImageService` import from your Astro config. By default, you will use Sharp for `astro:assets`.

```ts title="astro.config.mjs" del={1, 5-7}
import { squooshImageService } from "astro/config";
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";

export default defineConfig({
 image: {
   service: squooshImageService()
 }
});
```

If you are using a strict package manager like `pnpm`, you may need to install the `sharp` package manually to use the Sharp image service, even though it is built-in to Astro by default.

If your adapter for server or hybrid mode does not support Astro's built-in Sharp image optimization, you can [configure a no-op image service](/en/guides/images/#configure-no-op-passthrough-service) to allow you to use the `<Image />` and `<Picture />` components.

Alternatively, you may wish to consider [a community-maintained Squoosh image service](https://github.com/Princesseuh/astro-image-service-squoosh) if you are unable to use the Sharp image service.


##### For adapters

If your adapter previously precised its compatibility status with Squoosh, you should now remove this information from your adapter configuration.

```diff lang="ts" title="my-adapter.mjs"
supportedAstroFeatures: {
  assets: {
--    isSquooshCompatible: true,
  },
}
```

### Removed: Internal JSX exports entrypoints (PLT1935 - alpha.1)

<SourcePR number="11741" title="Cleanup unused JSX code"/>

In Astro v4.x, Astro performed internal JSX handling for the `@astrojs/mdx` integration.

Astro v5.0 moves this responsibility tohandle and render JSX and MDX the `@astrojs/mdx` package directly, and removes the following exports:

- `astro/jsx/babel.js`
 - `astro/jsx/component.js`
 - `astro/jsx/index.js`
 - `astro/jsx/renderer.js`
 - `astro/jsx/server.js`
 - `astro/jsx/transform-options.js`

#### What should I do?

If your project includes `.mdx` files, you must upgrade `@astrojs/mdx` to the latest version so that your JSX can be handled properly by the integration and no longer relies on these removed entrypoints.

### Changed: route priority order (PLT2087 - alpha.1)

<SourcePR number="11798" title="Remove legacy route prioritization"/>

In Astro v4.x, `experimental.globalRoutePriority` was an optional flag which ensured that injected routes, file-based routes, and redirects were all prioritized using the [route priority order rules for all routes](/en/guides/routing/#route-priority-order). This allowed more control over routing in your project by not automatically prioritizing certain kinds of routes, and standardizing the route priority order.

Astro v5.0 removes this experimental flag and makes this the new default behavior in Astro: redirects and injected routes are now prioritized equally alongside file-based project routes.

Note that this was already the default behavior in Starlight, and should not affect updated Starlight projects.

#### What should I do?

If your project includes injected routes or redirects, please check that your routes are building page URLs as expected. An example of the new expected behavior is shown below.

In a project containing the following routes:

- File-based route: `/blog/post/[pid]`
- File-based route: `/[page]`
- Injected route: `/blog/[...slug]`
- Redirect: `/blog/tags/[tag] -> /[tag]`
- Redirect: `/posts -> /blog`

The following URLs will be built (instead of following the route priority order of Astro v4.x):

- `/blog/tags/astro` is built by the redirect to `/tags/[tag]` (instead of the injected route `/blog/[...slug]`)
- `/blog/post/0` is built by the file-based route `/blog/post/[pid]` (instead of the injected route `/blog/[...slug]`)
- `/posts` is built by the redirect to `/blog` (instead of the file-based route `/[page]`)

In the event of route collisions, where two routes of equal route priority attempt to build the same URL, Astro will log a warning identifying the conflicting routes.

### Changed: default `<script>` behavior (PLT2086 - alpha.2)

<SourcePR number="11791" title="Make directRenderScript the default"/>

In Astro v4.x, `experimental.directRenderScript` was an optional flag to directly render `<scripts>` as declared in `.astro` files (including existing features like TypeScript, importing `node_modules`, and deduplicating scripts). This strategy prevented scripts from being executed in places where they were not used.

Astro 5.0 removes this experimental flag and makes this the new default behavior in Astro: scripts are no longer hoisted to the `<head>`, multiple scripts on a page are no longer bundled together, and a `<script>` tag may interfere with CSS styling.

#### What should I do?

Please review your `<script>` tags and ensure they behave as desired.

#### What should I do?

### Changed: add base to `paginate` (PLT2204 - alpha.2)

<SourcePR number="11253" title="Add base to paginate"/>

In Astro v4.x, the URL returned by `paginate()` (e.g. `page.url.next`, `page.url.first`, etc.) did not include the value set for `base` in your Astro config. You had to manually prepend your configured value for `base` to the URL path.

Astro 5.0 automatically includes the `base` value in `page.url`.

#### What should I do?

If you are using the `paginate()` function for "previous" and "next" URLs, remove any existing `base` value as it is now added for you:

```astro del={16} ins={17}
---
export async function getStaticPaths({ paginate }) {
  const astronautPages = [{
    astronaut: 'Neil Armstrong',
  }, {
    astronaut: 'Buzz Aldrin',
  }, {
    astronaut: 'Sally Ride',
  }, {
    astronaut: 'John Glenn',
  }];
  return paginate(astronautPages, { pageSize: 1 });
}
const { page } = Astro.props;
// `base: /'docs'` configured in `astro.config.mjs`
const prev = "/docs" + page.url.prev;
const prev = page.url.prev;
---
<a id="prev" href={prev}>Back</a>
```

### Changed: `astro:content` can no longer be used on the client (PLT2118 - alpha.2)

<SourcePR number="11827" title="Prevent usage of `astro:content` in the client "/>

The `astro:content` module can no longer be used on the client. It was never intentionally exposed for client usage, leading to some developers to use it without realizing the limitations and bloat to client bundles.

#### What should I do?

If currently using in the client, consider instead passing the data you need through properties to your client components:

```astro
---
import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';
import ClientComponent from '../components/ClientComponent';

const posts = await getCollection('blog');
const postsData = posts.map(post => post.data);
---

<ClientComponent posts={postsData} />
```

### Changed: TypeScript configuration (PLT2470)

<SourcePR number="11859" title="better tsconfig"/>

In Astro v4.x, Astro relied on a `src/env.d.ts` file for type inferencing and defining modules for features that relied on generated types.

Astro 5.0 instead uses a `.astro/types/d.ts` file for type inferencing, and now recommends setting `include` and `exclude` in `tsconfig.json` to benefit from Astro types and avoid checking built files. Running `astro sync` no longer creates, nor updates, `src/env.d.ts` as it is not required for type-checking standard Astro projects.

#### What should I do?

To update your project to Astro's recommended TypeScript settings, please add the following `include` and `exclude` properties to your existing `tsconfig.json`:

```ts ins={3,4} title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "extends": "astro/tsconfigs/base",
  "include": ["**/*", ".astro/types.d.ts"],
  "exclude": ["dist"]
}
```

Note that `src/env.d.ts` is only necessary if you have added custom or if you're not using a `tsconfig.json` file.

### Changed: Fix shiki syntax highlighting to output hast for performance (PLT1946) 

<SourcePR number="11825" title="Refactor createShikiHighlighter"/>

Updates internal Shiki rehype plugin to highlight code blocks as hast (using Shiki's `codeToHast()` API). This allows a more direct markdown and MDX processing, and improves the performance when building the project.

However, a caveat with `codeToHast()` is that Shiki transformers' `postprocess` hook will now not run on code blocks in `.md` and `.mdx` files (also [documented in Shiki](https://shiki.style/guide/transformers#transformer-hooks)). Make sure the Shiki transformers passed to `markdown.shikiConfig.transformers` do not use the `postprocess` hook to avoid issues with the HTML output.

Code blocks in `.mdoc` files and `<Code />` component will still work the same and shouldn't need any changes as they do not use the internal Shiki rehype plugin.

#### What should I do?

Stuff!


### Changed: Astro-specfic metadata attached to `vfile.data` in Remark and Rehype plugins (PLT-1897) 

<SourcePR number="11861" title="Clean up Astro metadata in vfile.data"/>

Cleans up Astro-specfic metadata attached to `vfile.data` in Remark and Rehype plugins. Previously, the metadata is attached in different locations with inconsistent names. The metadata is now renamed as below:

- `vfile.data.__astroHeadings` -> `vfile.data.astro.headings`
- `vfile.data.imagePaths` -> `vfile.data.astro.imagePaths`

The types of `imagePaths` has also been updated from `Set<string>` to `string[]`. The `vfile.data.astro.frontmatter` metadata is left unchanged.

While we don't consider these APIs public, it can be accessed by Remark and Rehype plugins that wants to re-use Astro's metadata. If you are using these APIs, make sure to access them in the new locations.

#### What should I do?

Stuff!

### Changed: `entryPoint` type inside the hook `astro:build:ssr` (PLT2338)

<SourcePR number="11864" title="send `IntegrationRouteData` to integrations"/>

In Astro v4.x, the `entryPoint` type was `RouteData`.

Astro v5.0 the `entryPoint` type is `IntegrationRouteData`, which contains a subset of the `RouteData` type. The fields `isIndex` and `fallbackRoutes` were removed. 

#### What should I do?

Update your adapter to change the type of `entryPoint` from `RouteData` to `IntegrationRouteData`.

```diff
-import type {RouteData} from 'astro';
+import type {IntegrationRouteData} from "astro"

-function useRoute(route: RouteData) {
+function useRoute(route: IntegrationRouteData) {

}
```

#### What should I do?

Stuff!

### Changed: Rework `supportedAstroFeatures.assets` (PLT-989) 

<SourcePR number="11806" title="rework supportedAstroFeatures"/>

- (PLT-989) Rework `supportedAstroFeatures.assets`

#### What should I do?

Stuff!

#### What should I do?

Stuff!

### Changed: set `ssr.external: true` when using Vite to load configs (PLT1631)

<SourcePR number="11819" title="Set external: true when loading astro config"/>

Updates the Astro config loading flow to ignore processing locally-linked dependencies with Vite (e.g. `npm link`, in a monorepo, etc). Instead, they will be normally imported by the Node.js runtime the same way as other dependencies from `node_modules`.

Previously, Astro would process locally-linked dependencies when they were able to use Vite features like TypeScript when imported by the Astro config file. 
	
However, this caused confusion as integration authors may test against a package that worked locally, but not when published. This method also restricts using CJS-only dependencies because Vite requires the code to be ESM. Therefore, Astro's behaviour is now changed to ignore processing any type of dependencies by Vite.

#### What should I do?

In most cases, make sure your locally-linked dependencies are built to JS before running the Astro project, and the config loading should work as before.

### Changed: auto-inject `<meta charset="utf-8">` by default for every astro/md/mdx/html (PLT1057)

Decide if charset=utf-8 should not be set for md/mdx pages by default

#### What should I do?

Stuff!

### Changed: Merge `static` and `hybrid` (PLT2434)

Static and hybrid have been merged

#### What should I do?

Stuff!

### Changed: `--mode` usage (PLT2220)

Rethink `--mode` and internal mode usage

#### What should I do?

Stuff!

### Changed: Renamed `<ViewTransitions>` component (PLT2423)

The view transitions component has been renamed

#### What should I do?

Stuff!

### Changed: `<script type="module">` no longer implies `is:inline` (PLT1548)

COnsider supporting `type="module"` for people who want to set it explicitly

#### What should I do?

Stuff!

## Deprecated

The following deprecated features are no longer supported and are no longer documented. Please update your project accordingly.

Some deprecated features may temporarily continue to function until they are completely removed. Others may silently have no effect, or throw an error prompting you to update your code.

### Deprecated: `Astro.glob` (PLT2436 - alpha.2)

<SourcePR number="11826" title="Deprecate glob"/>

In Astro v4.x, you could use `Astro.glob` in your `.astro` components to query multiple files in your project. This had some limitations (where it could be used, performance, etc.) and using querying functions from the Content Collections API or Vite's own `import.meta.glob` often provided more function and flexibility.

Astro 5.0 deprecates `Astro.glob()` in favour of using `getCollection()` to query your collections, and `import.meta.glob` to query other source files in your project.

#### What should I do?

Replace all use of `Astro.glob()` with `import.meta.glob()`. In most cases, this should work as a direct substitution. You should not require any updates to your [glob patterns](/en/guides/imports/#glob-patterns).

```astro title="src/pages/blog.astro" del={2} ins={3}
---
const posts = Astro.glob('./posts/*.md');
const posts = Object.values(import.meta.glob('./posts/*.md', { eager: true }));
---

{posts.map((post) => <li><a href={post.url}>{post.frontmatter.title}</a></li>)}
```

Where appropriate, consider using [content collections](/en/guides/content-collections/) to organize your content, which has its own newer, more performant querying functions.

You may also wish to consider using glob packages from NPM, such as [`fast-glob`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fast-glob).
 
### Deprecated: `functionPerRoute` (Adapter API) (PLT2150 - alpha.0)

<SourcePR number="11714" title="Remove functionPerRoute option"/>

In Astro v4.x, you could opt in to creating a separate file for each route defined in the project, mirroring your `src/pages/` directory in the build folder. By default, Astro emitted a single `entry.mjs` file, which was responsible for emitting the rendered page on each request.

Astro v5.0 removes the option to opt out of the default behavior. This behavior is now standard, and non-configurable.

Remove the `functionPerRoute` property from your `adapterFeatures` configuration. It is no longer available.

```js title="my-adapter.mjs" del={10}
export default function createIntegration() {
  return {
    name: '@matthewp/my-adapter',
    hooks: {
      'astro:config:done': ({ setAdapter }) => {
        setAdapter({
          name: '@matthewp/my-adapter',
          serverEntrypoint: '@matthewp/my-adapter/server.js',
          adapterFeatures: {
              functionPerRoute: true
          }
        });
      },
    },
  };
}

```

### Deprecated: `define:vars` (core) (PLT2145)

In Astro v4.x,

Astro v5.0 removes the directive


#### What should I do?

Choose a different value

## Removed

The following features have now been entirely removed from the code base and can no longer be used. Some of these features may have continued to work in your project even after deprecation. Others may have silently had no effect.

Projects now containing these removed features will be unable to build, and there will no longer be any supporting documentation prompting you to remove these features.

### Removed: The Lit integration (integrations) (PLT2146)

<SourcePR number="11680" title="Remove `@astrojs/lit`"/>

In Astro v4.x, [Lit](https://lit.dev/) was a core-maintained framework library through the `@astrojs/lit` package.

Astro v5.0 removes the integration and it will not receive further updates for compatibility with 5.x and above.


#### What should I do?

You can continue to use Lit for client components simply by adding a client-side script tag. For example:

```astro
<script>
  import "../components/MyTabs";
</script>

If you're interested in maintaining a Lit integration yourself, you may wish to use the [last published version of `@astrojs/lit`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/astro%404.13.0/packages/integrations/lit) as a starting point and upgrade the relevant packages.


### Removed: `prerender` option in `injectRoute` (PLT2342)

In Astro v4.x the `injectRoute` integration function accepted `prerender: true` as an option, which would cause the route to be prerendered at build time.

Astro v5.0 removes this option and it should no longer be used.

#### What should I do?

In your injected route, add the `prerender` export like you would for routes defined in the `pages` directory:

```astro
---
export const prerender = true
---
```
