This guide will help you migrate from Astro v5 to Astro v6.

Need to upgrade an older project to v5 first? See our [older migration guide](/en/guides/upgrade-to/v5/).

Need to see the v5 docs? Visit this [older version of the docs site (unmaintained v5.xx snapshot)](https://v5.docs.astro.build/).

## Upgrade Astro

Update your project's version of Astro to the latest version using your package manager:

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```shell
  # Upgrade Astro and official integrations together
  npx @astrojs/upgrade
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```shell
  # Upgrade Astro and official integrations together
  pnpm dlx @astrojs/upgrade
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```shell
  # Upgrade Astro and official integrations together
  yarn dlx @astrojs/upgrade
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

You can also [upgrade your Astro integrations manually](/en/guides/integrations-guide/#manual-upgrading) if needed, and you may also need to upgrade other dependencies in your project.

:::note[Need to continue?]
After upgrading Astro, you may not need to make any changes to your project at all!

But, if you notice errors or unexpected behavior, please check below for what has changed that might need updating in your project.
:::

Astro v6.0 includes [potentially breaking changes](#breaking-changes), as well as the removal and deprecation of some features.

If your project doesn't work as expected after upgrading to v6.0, check this guide for an overview of all breaking changes and instructions on how to update your codebase.

See [the Astro changelog](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/astro/CHANGELOG.md) for full release notes.

## Dependency Upgrades

Any major upgrades to Astro's dependencies may cause breaking changes in your project.

### Node 22

<SourcePR number="14427" title="feat!: drop node 18 and 20"/>

Node 18 reached its End of Life in March 2025 and Node 20 is scheduled to reach its End of Life in April 2026.

Astro v6.0 drops Node 18 and Node 20 support entirely so that all Astro users can take advantage of Node's more modern features.

#### What should I do?

Check that both your development environment and your deployment environment are using **Node `22.12.0` or higher**.

<Steps>
1. Check your local version of Node using:

    ```sh
    node -v
    ```

2. Check your [deployment environment's](/en/guides/deploy/) own documentation to verify that they support Node 22.

    You can specify Node `22.12.0` for your Astro project either in a dashboard configuration setting or a `.nvmrc` file.

    ```bash title=".nvmrc"
    22.12.0
    ```
</Steps>

### Vite 7.0

<SourcePR number="14445" title="feat: update vite"/>

Astro v6.0 upgrades to Vite v7.0 as the development server and production bundler.

#### What should I do?

If you are using Vite-specific plugins, configuration, or APIs, check the [Vite migration guide](https://vite.dev/guide/migration) for their breaking changes and upgrade your project as needed.

## Legacy

The following features are now considered legacy features. They should function normally but are no longer recommended and are in maintenance mode. They will see no future improvements and documentation will not be updated. These features will eventually be deprecated, and then removed entirely.

## Deprecated

The following deprecated features are no longer supported and are no longer documented. Please update your project accordingly.

Some deprecated features may temporarily continue to function until they are completely removed. Others may silently have no effect, or throw an error prompting you to update your code.

### Deprecated: `Astro` in `getStaticPaths()`

<SourcePR number="14432" title="feat: deprecate Astro in getStaticPaths"/>

In Astro 5.x, it was possible to access an `Astro` object inside `getStaticPaths()`. However, despite being typed the same as the `Astro` object accessible in the frontmatter, this object only had `site` and `generator` properties. This could lead to confusion about which `Astro` object properties were available inside `getStaticPaths()`.

Astro 6.0 deprecates this object for `getStaticPaths()` to avoid confusion and improves error handling when attempting to access `Astro` values that are unavailable. Using `Astro.site` or `Astro.generator` within `getStaticPaths()` will now log a deprecation warning, and accessing any other property will throw a specific error with a helpful message. In a future major version, this object will be removed entirely, and accessing `Astro.site` or `Astro.generator` will also throw an error.

#### What should I do?

Update your `getStaticPaths()` function if you were attempting to access any `Astro` properties inside its scope. Remove `Astro.generator` entirely, and replace all occurrences of `Astro.site()` with `import.meta.env.SITE`:

```astro title="src/pages/blog/[slug].astro" del={5,6} ins={7}
---
import { getPages } from "../../../utils/data";

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  console.log(Astro.generator);
  return getPages(Astro.site);
  return getPages(import.meta.env.SITE);
}
---
```

<ReadMore>Read more about [built-in environment variables such as `import.meta.env.SITE`](/en/guides/environment-variables/#default-environment-variables) that are accessible when [using `getStaticPaths()` to dynamically generate static routes](/en/guides/routing/#static-ssg-mode).</ReadMore>

### Deprecated: `import.meta.env.ASSETS_PREFIX`

<SourcePR number="14461" title="feat: deprecate import.meta.env.ASSETS_PREFIX"/>

In Astro 5.x, it was possible to access `build.assetsPrefix` in your Astro config via the built-in environment variable `import.meta.env.ASSETS_PREFIX`. However, Astro v5.7.0 introduced the `astro:config` virtual model to expose a non-exhaustive, serializable, type-safe version of the Astro configuration which included access to `build.assetsPrefix` directly. This became the preferred way to access the prefix for Astro-generated asset links when set, although the environment variable still existed.

Astro 6.0 deprecates this variable in favor of `build.assetsPrefix` from the `astro:config/server` module.

#### What should I do?

Replace any occurances of `import.meta.env.ASSETS_PREFIX` with the `build.assetsPrefix` import from `astro:config/server`. This is a drop-in replacement to provide the existing value, and no other changes to your code should be necessary:

```ts del={4} ins={2,5}
import { someLogic } from "./utils"
import { build } from "astro:config/server"

someLogic(import.meta.env.ASSETS_PREFIX)
someLogic(build.assetsPrefix)
```

<ReadMore>Read more about the [`astro:config` virtual modules](/en/reference/modules/astro-config/).</ReadMore>

## Removed

The following features have now been entirely removed from the code base and can no longer be used. Some of these features may have continued to work in your project even after deprecation. Others may have silently had no effect.

Projects now containing these removed features will be unable to build, and there will no longer be any supporting documentation prompting you to remove these features.


### Removed: legacy content collections

<SourcePR number="14407" title="fix: remove legacy content collections"/>

In Astro 5.x, it was still possible to use [the original Content Collections API first introduced in Astro v2.0](https://astro.build/blog/introducing-content-collections/), either through a `legacy` configuration flag or via built-in backwards compatibility. These methods allowed you to upgrade to Astro v5 even if you were not yet ready or able to update your existing content collections to those powered by the new Content Layer API.

**Astro v6.0 removes this previously deprecated Content Collections API support entirely, including the `legacy.collections` flag.** All content collections must now use [the Content Layer API introduced in Astro v5.0](https://astro.build/blog/content-layer-deep-dive/) that powers all content collections. No backwards compatibility support is available.

#### What should I do?

If you had previously enabled the legacy flag, you must remove it.

```ts title="astro.config.mjs" del={5}
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  legacy: {
    collections: true,
  }
})
```

Additionally, if you did not upgrade your collections for Astro v5.0, ensure that your content collections are **fully updated** for the new API.

Astro v5.x included some automatic backwards compatibility to allow content collections to continue to work even if they had not been updated to use the new API. Therefore, your v5 collections may contain one or more legacy features that need updating to the newer API for v6, even if your project was previously error-free.

If you have [content collections errors](/en/reference/error-reference/#content-collection-errors) or warnings after upgrading to v6, use the following list to help you identify and upgrade any legacy features that may exist in your code.

##### If you have...

<details>
<summary>no content collections configuration file</summary>
Create `src/content.config.ts` and [define your collections](/en/guides/content-collections/#build-time-content-collections) in it.
</details>

<details>
<summary>a configuration file located at `src/content/config.ts` / ([`LegacyContentConfigError`](/en/reference/errors/legacy-content-config-error/))</summary>
Rename and move this file to `src/content.config.ts`
</details>

<details>
<summary>a collection that does not define a `loader`/ ([`ContentCollectionMissingALoaderError`](/en/reference/errors/content-collection-missing-loader/))</summary>

Import [Astro's built-in `glob()` loader](/en/guides/content-collections/#the-glob-loader) and define the `pattern` and `base` for your collection entries:

```ts ins={3,6}
// src/content.config.ts
import { defineCollection, z } from 'astro:content';
import { glob } from 'astro/loaders';

const blog = defineCollection({
  loader: glob({ pattern: '**/[^_]*.{md,mdx}', base: "./src/data/blog" }),
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    description: z.string(),
    pubDate: z.coerce.date(),
    updatedDate: z.coerce.date().optional(),
  }),
});
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>a collection that defines a collection type (`type: 'content'` or `type: 'data'`) / ([`ContentCollectionInvalidTypeError`](/en/reference/errors/content-collection-invalid-type/))</summary>
There are no longer different types of collections. This must be deleted from your collection definition.

```ts del={7}
// src/content.config.ts
import { defineCollection, z } from 'astro:content';
import { glob } from 'astro/loaders';

const blog = defineCollection({
  // For content layer you no longer define a `type`
  type: 'content',
  loader: glob({ pattern: '**/[^_]*.{md,mdx}', base: "./src/data/blog" }),
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    description: z.string(),
    pubDate: z.coerce.date(),
    updatedDate: z.coerce.date().optional(),
  }),
});
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>legacy collection querying methods `getDataEntryById()` and `getEntryBySlug()` / ([`GetEntryDeprecationError`](/en/reference/errors/get-entry-deprecation-error/))</summary>
Replace both methods with [`getEntry()`](/en/reference/modules/astro-content/#getentry).

</details>

<details>
<summary>legacy collection querying and rendering methods that depend on a `slug` property / ([`ContentSchemaContainsSlugError`](/en/reference/errors/content-schema-contains-slug-error/))</summary>
Previously, the `id` was based on the filename, and there was a `slug` property that could be used in a URL. Now the [CollectionEntry](/en/reference/modules/astro-content/#collectionentry) `id` is a slug. If you need access to the filename (previously available as the `id`), use the `filePath` property. Replace instances of `slug` with `id`:

```astro ins={6} del={5} title="src/pages/[slug].astro"
---
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const posts = await getCollection('blog');
  return posts.map((post) => ({
    params: { slug: post.slug },
    params: { slug: post.id },
    props: post,
  }));
}
---
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>content rendered using `entry.render()`</summary>
Collection entries no longer have a `render()` method. Instead, import the `render()` function from `astro:content` and use `render(entry)`:

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" ins=", render" del={6} ins={7}
---
import { getEntry, render } from 'astro:content';

const post = await getEntry('pages', 'homepage');

const { Content, headings } = await post.render();
const { Content, headings } = await render(post);
---
<Content />
```

</details>

<ReadMore> See [the Astro v5 upgrade guide](/en/guides/upgrade-to/v5/#legacy-v20-content-collections-api) for previous guidance about backwards compatibility of legacy collections in Astro v5 and full step-by-step instructions for upgrading legacy collections to the new Content Layer API.</ReadMore>


### Removed: `<ViewTransitions />` component

<SourcePR number="14400" title="Remove deprecated ViewTransitions component"/>

In Astro 5.0, the `<ViewTransitions />` component was renamed to `<ClientRouter />` to clarify the role of the component. The new name makes it more clear that the features you get from Astro's `<ClientRouter />` routing component are slightly different from the native CSS-based MPA router. However, a deprecated version of the `<ViewTransitions />` component still existed and may have functioned in Astro 5.x.

Astro 6.0 removes the `<ViewTransitions />` component entirely and it can no longer be used in your project. Update to the `<ClientRouter />` component to continue to use these features.

#### What should I do?

Replace all occurrences of the `ViewTransitions` import and component with `ClientRouter`:

```astro title="src/layouts/MyLayout.astro" del={1,7} ins={2,8}
import { ViewTransitions } from 'astro:transitions';
import { ClientRouter } from 'astro:transitions';

<html>
  <head>
    ...
   <ViewTransitions />
   <ClientRouter />
  </head>
</html>
```

<ReadMore>Read more about [view transitions and client-side routing in Astro](/en/guides/view-transitions/).</ReadMore>

### Removed: `emitESMImage()`

<SourcePR number="14426" title="feat!: remove emitESMImage()"/>

In Astro 5.6.2, the `emitESMImage()` function was deprecated in favor of `emitImageMetadata()`, which removes two deprecated arguments that were not meant to be exposed for public use: `_watchMode` and `experimentalSvgEnabled`.

Astro 6.0 removes `emitESMImage()` entirely. Update to `emitImageMetadata()` to keep your current behavior.

#### What should I do?

Replace all occurrences of the `emitESMImage()` with `emitImageMetadata()` and remove unused arguments:

```ts del={1,5} ins={2,6}
import { emitESMImage } from 'astro/assets/utils';
import { emitImageMetadata } from 'astro/assets/utils';

const imageId = '/images/photo.jpg';
const result = await emitESMImage(imageId, false, false);
const result = await emitImageMetadata(imageId);
```

<ReadMore>Read more about [`emitImageMetadata()`](/en/reference/image-service-reference/#emitimagemetadata).</ReadMore>

### Removed: `Astro.glob()`

<SourcePR number="14421" title="feat!: remove Astro.glob"/>

In Astro 5.0, `Astro.glob()` was deprecated in favor of using `getCollection()` to query your collections, and `import.meta.glob()` to query other source files in your project.

Astro 6.0 removes `Astro.glob()` entirely. Update to `import.meta.glob()` to keep your current behavior.

#### What should I do?

Replace all use of `Astro.glob()` with `import.meta.glob()`. Note that `import.meta.glob()` no longer returns a `Promise`, so you may have to update your code accordingly. You should not require any updates to your [glob patterns](/en/guides/imports/#glob-patterns).

```astro title="src/pages/blog.astro" del={2} ins={3}
---
const posts = await Astro.glob('./posts/*.md');
const posts = Object.values(import.meta.glob('./posts/*.md', { eager: true }));
---

{posts.map((post) => <li><a href={post.url}>{post.frontmatter.title}</a></li>)}
```

Where appropriate, consider using [content collections](/en/guides/content-collections/) to organize your content, which has its own newer, more performant querying functions.

You may also wish to consider using glob packages from NPM, such as [`fast-glob`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fast-glob).

<ReadMore>Learn more about [importing files with `import.meta.glob`](/en/guides/imports/#importmetaglob).</ReadMore>

### Removed: `routes` on `astro:build:done` hook (Integration API)

<SourcePR number="14446" title="feat: cleanup integration api"/>

In Astro 5.0, accessing `routes` on the `astro:build:done` hook was deprecated.

Astro 6.0 removes the `routes` array passed to this hook entirely. Instead, the `astro:routes:resolved` hook should be used. 

#### What should I do?

Remove any instance of `routes` passed to `astro:build:done` and replace it with the new `astro:routes:resolved` hook. Access `distURL` on the newly exposed `assets` map:

```js title="my-integration.mjs" ins={2,6-8,11,13-18} del={10}
const integration = () => {
    let routes
    return {
        name: 'my-integration',
        hooks: {
            'astro:routes:resolved': (params) => {
                routes = params.routes
            },
            'astro:build:done': ({
                routes
                assets
            }) => {
                for (const route of routes) {
                    const distURL = assets.get(route.pattern)
                    if (distURL) {
                        Object.assign(route, { distURL })
                    }
                }
                console.log(routes)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

<ReadMore>Learn more about [the Integration API `astro:routes:resolved` hook](/en/reference/integrations-reference/#astroroutesresolved) for building integrations.</ReadMore>

### Removed: `entryPoints` on `astro:build:ssr` hook (Integration API)

<SourcePR number="14446" title="feat: cleanup integration api"/>

In Astro 5.0, [`functionPerRoute` was deprecated](/en/guides/upgrade-to/v5/#deprecated-functionperroute-adapter-api). That meant that `entryPoints` on the `astro:build:ssr` hook was always empty.

Astro 6.0 removes the `entryPoints` map passed to this hook entirely.

#### What should I do?

Remove any instance of `entryPoints` passed to `astro:build:ssr`:

```js title="my-integration.mjs" del={6}
const integration = () => {
    return {
        name: 'my-integration',
        hooks: {
            'astro:build:ssr': (params) => {
                someLogic(params.entryPoints)
            },
        }
    }
}
```

### Removed: old `app.render()` signature (Adapter API)

<SourcePR number="14462" title="feat: clean deprecated APIs"/>

In Astro 4.0, the `app.render()` signature that allowed passing `routeData` and `locals` as optional arguments was deprecated in favor of a single optional `renderOptions` argument.

Astro 6.0 removes this signature entirely. Attempting to pass these separate arguments will now cause an error in your project.

#### What should I do?

Review your `app.render` calls and pass `routeData` and `locals` as properties of an object instead of as multiple independent arguments:

```ts title="my-adapter/entrypoint.ts" del={1} ins={2}
app.render(request, routeData, locals)
app.render(request, { routeData, locals })
```

<ReadMore>Learn more about the [Adapter API](/en/reference/adapter-reference/).</ReadMore>

### Removed: `handleForms` prop for the `<ClientRouter />` component

<SourcePR number="14462" title="feat: clean deprecated APIs"/>

In Astro 4.0, the `handleForms` prop of the `<ClientRouter />` component was deprecated, as it was no longer necessary to opt in to handling `submit` events for `form` elements. This functionality has been built in by default and the property, if still included in your project, silently had no impact on form submission.

Astro 6.0 removes this prop entirely and it now must be removed to avoid errors in your project.

#### What should I do?

Remove the `handleForms` property from your `<ClientRouter />` component if it exists. It has provided no additional functionality, and so removing it should not change any behavior in your project:

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" del="handleForms"
---
import { ClientRouter } from "astro:transitions";
---
<html>
  <head>
    <ClientRouter handleForms />
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- stuff here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

<ReadMore>Learn more about [transitions with forms](/en/guides/view-transitions/#transitions-with-forms).</ReadMore>

### Removed: `prefetch()` `with` option

<SourcePR number="14462" title="feat: clean deprecated APIs"/>

In Astro 4.8.4, the `with` option of the programmatic `prefetch()` function was deprecated in favor of a more sensible default behavior that no longer required specifying the priority of prefetching for each page.

Astro 6.0 removes this option entirely and it is no longer possible to configure the priority of prefetching by passing the `with` option. Attempting to do so will now cause errors.

By default, Astro's prefetching now uses an automatic approach that will always try to use `<link rel="prefetch>` if supported, or will fall back to `fetch()`.

#### What should I do?

Review your `prefetch()` calls and remove the `with` option if it still exists:

```ts del={1} ins={2}
prefetch('/about', { with: 'fetch' });
prefetch('/about');
```

<ReadMore>Learn more about [prefetching](/en/guides/prefetch/).</ReadMore>

### Removed: `rewrite()` from Actions context

<SourcePR number="14477" title="feat!: remove rewrite from action context"/>

In Astro 5.5.6, the `ActionAPIContext.rewrite` method was deprecated because custom endpoints should be used instead of rewrites.

Astro 6.0 removes the `rewrite()` method from `ActionAPIContext` entirely and it may no longer be used.

#### What should I do?

Review your Actions handlers and remove any call to `rewrite()`:


```ts title="src/actions/index.ts" del={10}
import { defineAction } from 'astro:actions';
import { z } from 'astro:schema';

export const server = {
  getGreeting: defineAction({
    input: z.object({
      // ...
    }),
    handler: async (input, context) => {
      context.rewrite('/')
      // ...
    }
  })
}
```

<ReadMore>Learn more about [rewrites](/en/guides/routing/#rewrites).</ReadMore>

### Experimental Flags

Experimental flags allow you to opt in to features while they are in early development. Astro may also use experimental flags to test breaking changes to default behavior. The following experimental flags have been removed in Astro 6.0 and are now stable, or the new default behavior.

Remove these experimental flags from your Astro config if you were previously using them:

```js del={5-8} title="astro.config.mjs"
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  experimental: {
    liveContentCollections: true,
    preserveScriptOrder: true,
    staticImportMetaEnv: true,
    headingIdCompat: true,
  },
})
```

#### Experimental features now stable:

- `liveContentCollections` (See the updated [content collections docs](/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more about live collections.)

#### New default or recommended behavior:

- `preserveScriptOrder` (See below for breaking changes to [default `<script>` and `<style>` behavior](#changed-script-and-style-tags-are-rendered-in-the-order-they-are-defined).)
- `staticImportMetaEnv` (See below for breaking changes to [`import.meta.env`](#changed-importmetaenv-values-are-always-inlined).)
- `headingIdCompat` (See below for breaking changes to [Markdown heading ID generation](#changed-markdown-heading-id-generation).)

<ReadMore>Read about exciting new features and more in [the v6.0 Blog post](https://astro.build/blog/astro-6/).</ReadMore>


## Changed Defaults

Some default behavior has changed in Astro v5.0 and your project code may need updating to account for these changes.

In most cases, the only action needed is to review your existing project's deployment and ensure that it continues to function as you expect, making updates to your code as necessary. In some cases, there may be a configuration setting to allow you to continue to use the previous default behavior.

### Changed: `i18n.routing.redirectToDefaultLocale` default value

<SourcePR number="14406" title="feat(astro)!: update i18n.redirectToDefaultLocale default"/>

In Astro v5.0, the `i18n.routing.redirectToDefaultLocale` default value was `true`. When combined with the `i18n.routing.prefixDefaultLocale` default value of `false`, the resulting redirects could cause infinite loops.

In Astro v6.0, `i18n.routing.redirectToDefaultLocale` now defaults to `false`. Additionally, it can now only be used if `i18n.routing.prefixDefaultLocale` is set to `true`.

#### What should I do?

Review your Astro `i18n` config as you may now need to explicitly set values for `redirectToDefaultLocale` and `prefixDefaultLocale` to recreate your project's previous behavior.

```js ins={7} title="astro.config.mjs"
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  i18n: {
    routing: {
      prefixDefaultLocale: true,
      redirectToDefaultLocale: true
    }
  }
})
```

### Changed: `<script>` and `<style>` tags are rendered in the order they are defined

<SourcePR number="14480" title="feat: stabilize experimental preserveScriptOrder option"/>

In Astro v5.5, the `experimental.preserveScriptOrder` flag was introduced to render multiple `<style>` and `<script>` tags in the same order as they were declared in the source code. Astro 5.x reversed their order in your generated HTML output. This could give unexpected results, for example, CSS styles being overridden by earlier defined style tags when your site was built.

Astro 6.0 removes this experimental flag and makes this the new default behavior in Astro: scripts and styles are now rendered in the order defined in your code.

#### What should I do?

If you were previously using this experimental feature, you must [remove this experimental flag from your configuration](#experimental-flags) as it no longer exists.

Review your `<script>` and `<style>` tags to make sure they behave as desired. You may need to reverse their order:

```astro title="src/components/MyComponent.astro" del={4,10,15,19} ins={5,11,16,20}
<p>I am a component</p>
<style>
  body {
    background: red;
    background: yellow;
  }
</style>
<style>
  body {
    background: yellow;
    background: red;
  }
</style>
<script>
    console.log("hello")
    console.log("world")
</script>
<script>
    console.log("world!")
    console.log("hello!")
</script>
```

<ReadMore>Read more about [using `script`](/en/guides/client-side-scripts/) and [`style`](/en/guides/styling/) tags.</ReadMore>

## Breaking Changes

The following changes are considered breaking changes in Astro v5.0. Breaking changes may or may not provide temporary backwards compatibility. If you were using these features, you may have to update your code as recommended in each entry.

### Changed: endpoints with a file extension cannot be accessed with a trailing slash

<SourcePR number="14457" title="feat!: trailing slash never for endpoints with file extension"/>

In Astro v5.0, custom endpoints whose URL ended in a file extension (e.g. `/src/pages/sitemap.xml.ts` ) could be accessed with a trailing slash (`/sitemap.xml/`) or without (`/sitemap.xml`), regardless of the value configured for `build.trailingSlash`.

In Astro v6.0, these endpoints can only be accessed without a trailing slash. This is true regardless of your `build.trailingSlash` configuration.

#### What should I do?

Review your links to your custom endpoints that include a file extension in the URL and remove any trailing slashes:

```html del={1} ins={2} title="src/pages/index.astro"
<a href="/sitemap.xml/">Sitemap</a>
<a href="/sitemap.xml">Sitemap</a>
```

### Changed: `import.meta.env` values are always inlined

<SourcePR number="14485" title="feat: stabilize static import meta env"/>

In Astro 5.13, the `experimental.staticImportMetaEnv` flag was introduced to update the behavior when accessing `import.meta.env` directly to align with [Vite's handling of environment variables](https://vite.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-variables) and ensures that `import.meta.env` values are always inlined.

In Astro 5.x, non-public environment variables were replaced by a reference to `process.env`. Additionally, Astro could also convert the value type of your environment variables used through `import.meta.env`, which could prevent access to some values such as the strings `"true"` (which was converted to a boolean value), and `"1"` (which was converted to a number).

Astro 6 removes this experimental flag and makes this the new default behavior in Astro: `import.meta.env` values are always inlined and never coerced.

#### What should I do?

If you were previously using this experimental feature, you must [remove this experimental flag from your configuration](#experimental-flags) as it no longer exists.

If you were relying on coercion, you may need to update your project code to apply it manually:

```ts title="src/components/MyComponent.astro" del={1} ins={2}
const enabled: boolean = import.meta.env.ENABLED;
const enabled: boolean = import.meta.env.ENABLED === "true";
```

If you were relying on the transformation into `process.env`, you may need to update your project code to apply it manually:

```ts title="src/components/MyComponent.astro" del={1} ins={2}
const enabled: boolean = import.meta.env.DB_PASSWORD;
const enabled: boolean = process.env.DB_PASSWORD;
```

You may also need to update types:

```ts title="src/env.d.ts" del={3-4} ins={5,12-16}
interface ImportMetaEnv {
  readonly PUBLIC_POKEAPI: string;
  readonly DB_PASSWORD: string;
  readonly ENABLED: boolean;
  readonly ENABLED: string;
}

interface ImportMeta {
  readonly env: ImportMetaEnv;
}

namespace NodeJS {
  interface ProcessEnv {
    DB_PASSWORD: string;
  }
}
```

If you need more control over environment variables in Astro, we recommend you use `astro:env`.

### Changed: Markdown heading ID generation

<SourcePR number="14494" title="feat!: stabilize experimental.headingIdCompat"/>

In Astro 5.x, an additional default processing step to Markdown stripped trailing hyphens from the end of IDs for section headings ending in special characters. This provided a cleaner `id` value, but could lead to incompatibilities rendering your Markdown across platforms.

In Astro 5.5, the `experimental.headingIdCompat` flag was introduced to allow you to make the IDs generated by Astro for Markdown headings compatible with common platforms like GitHub and npm, using the popular [`github-slugger`](https://github.com/Flet/github-slugger) package.

Astro 6.0 removes this experimental flag and makes this the new default behavior in Astro: trailing hyphens from the end of IDs for headings ending in special characters are no longer removed.

#### What should I do?

If you have manual links to headings, you may need to update the anchor link value with a new trailing hyphen. For example, the following Markdown heading:

```md
## `<Picture />`
```

will now generate the following HTML with a trailing hyphen in the heading `id`:

```html ins="-"
<h2 id="picture-"><code>&lt;Picture /&gt;</h2>
```

and must now be linked to as:

```markdown ins="-"
See [the Picture component](/en/guides/images/#picture-) for more details.
```

If you were previously using the experimental feature to enforce trailing hyphens, you must [remove this experimental flag from your configuration](#experimental-flags) as it no longer exists.

If you were previously using the `rehypeHeadingIds` plugin directly to enforce compatibility, remove the `headingIdCompat` option as it no longer exists:

```js title="astro.config.mjs" del={8} ins={9}
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import { rehypeHeadingIds } from '@astrojs/markdown-remark';
import { otherPluginThatReliesOnHeadingIDs } from 'some/plugin/source';

export default defineConfig({
  markdown: {
    rehypePlugins: [
      [rehypeHeadingIds, { headingIdCompat: true }],
      [rehypeHeadingIds],
      otherPluginThatReliesOnHeadingIDs,
    ],
  },
});
```

If you want to keep the old ID generation for backward compatibility reasons, you can create a custom rehype plugin that will generate headings IDs like Astro 5.x. This will allow you to continue to use your existing anchor links without adding trailing hyphens.

<details>

<summary>Create a custom rehype plugin to strip trailing hyphens</summary>

<Steps>

1. Install required dependencies:

   <PackageManagerTabs>
   <Fragment slot="npm">
   ```sh
   npm i github-slugger hast-util-heading-rank unist-util-visit hast-util-to-string
   ```
   </Fragment>
   <Fragment slot="pnpm">
   ```sh
   pnpm add github-slugger hast-util-heading-rank unist-util-visit hast-util-to-string
   ```
   </Fragment>
   <Fragment slot="yarn">
   ```sh
   yarn add github-slugger hast-util-heading-rank unist-util-visit hast-util-to-string
   ```
   </Fragment>
   </PackageManagerTabs>
   
2. Create a custom rehype plugin that will generate headings IDs like Astro v5:

   ```js title="plugins/rehype-slug.mjs"
   import GithubSlugger from 'github-slugger';
   import { headingRank } from 'hast-util-heading-rank';
   import { visit } from 'unist-util-visit';
   import { toString } from 'hast-util-to-string';

   const slugs = new GithubSlugger();

   export function rehypeSlug() {
     /**
      * @param {import('hast').Root} tree
      */
     return (tree) => {
       slugs.reset();
       visit(tree, 'element', (node) => {
         if (headingRank(node) && !node.properties.id) {
           let slug = slugs.slug(toString(node));
           // Strip trailing hyphens like in Astro v5 and below:
           if (slug.endsWith('-')) slug = slug.slice(0, -1);
           node.properties.id = slug;
         }
       });
     };
   }
   ```
   
3. Add the custom plugin to your Markdown configuration in `astro.config.mjs`:

   ```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={2} ins="rehypeSlug"
   import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
   import { rehypeSlug } from './plugins/rehype-slug';
   
   export default defineConfig({
     markdown: {
       rehypePlugins: [rehypeSlug],
     },
   });
   ```

</Steps>

### Changed: `getStaticPaths()` cannot return `params` of type number

<SourcePR number="14586" title="fix!: disallow number in getStaticPaths params"/>

In Astro 5.x, `getStaticPaths()` could return `params` of type number, which would always be stringified by Astro. However, that could be confusing because it conflicted with `Astro.params` types.

Astro 6.0 removes this behavior: `getStaticPaths()` must now return string or undefined `params` values.

#### What should I do?

Review your dynamic routes using `getStaticPaths()` and convert any number params to strings:

```astro title="src/pages/post/[id]/[label].astro" del={6,13} ins={7,14}
---
export function getStaticPaths() {
  return [
    {
      params: {
        id: 1,
        id: "1",
        label: "foo",
      }
    },
    {
      params: {
        id: 2,
        id: "2",
        label: "bar",
      }
    },
  ]
}
---
```
