ButterCMS is a headless CMS and blog engine that allows you to publish structured content to use in your project.

## Integrating with Astro
:::note
For a full blog site example, see the [Astro + ButterCMS Starter Project](https://buttercms.com/starters/astro-starter-project/).
:::
In this section, we'll use the [ButterCMS SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/buttercms) to bring your data into your Astro project. 
To get started, you will need to have the following:
### Prerequisites

1. **An Astro project** - If you don't have an Astro project yet, our [Installation guide](/en/install/auto/) will get you up and running in no time.

2. **A ButterCMS account**. If you don't have an account, you can [sign up](https://buttercms.com/join/) for a free trial.

3. **Your ButterCMS API Token** - You can find your API Token on the [Settings](https://buttercms.com/settings/) page.

### Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your API token as an environment variable:

    ```ini title=".env"
    BUTTER_TOKEN=YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE
    ```

    :::tip
    Read more about [using environment variables](/en/guides/environment-variables/) and `.env` files in Astro.
    :::

2. Install the ButterCMS SDK as a dependency:
    <PackageManagerTabs>
      <Fragment slot="npm">
      ```shell
      npm install buttercms
      ```
      </Fragment>
      <Fragment slot="pnpm">
      ```shell
      pnpm install buttercms
      ```
      </Fragment>
      <Fragment slot="yarn">
      ```shell
      yarn add buttercms
      ```
      </Fragment>
    </PackageManagerTabs>

3. Create a `buttercms.js` file in a new `src/lib/` directory in your project:

    ```js title="src/lib/buttercms.js"
    import Butter from "buttercms";

    export const butterClient = Butter(import.meta.env.BUTTER_TOKEN);
    ```

**This authenticates the SDK using your API Token and exports it to be used across your project.**

### Fetching Data
To fetch content, import this client and use one of its `retrieve` functions. 

In this example, we [retrieve a collection](https://buttercms.com/docs/api/#retrieve-a-collection) that has three fields: a short text `name`, a number `price`, and a WYSIWYG `description`. 

```astro title="src/pages/ShopItem.astro"
---
import { butterClient } from "../lib/buttercms";
const response = await butterClient.content.retrieve(["shopitem"]);

interface ShopItem {
	name: string,
	price: number,
	description: string,
}

const items = response.data.data.shopitem as ShopItem[];
---
<body>
	{items.map(item => <div>
		<h2>{item.name} - ${item.price}</h2>
		<p set:html={item.description}></p>
	</div>)}
</body>
```

The interface mirrors the field types. The WYSIWYG `description` field loads as a string of HTML, and [`set:html`](/en/reference/directives-reference/#sethtml) lets you render it.

Similarly, you can [retrieve a page](https://buttercms.com/docs/api/#get-a-single-page) and display its fields:

```astro title="src/pages/ShopItem.astro"
---
import { butterClient } from "../lib/buttercms";
const response = await butterClient.page.retrieve("*", "simple-page");
const pageData = response.data.data;

interface Fields {
  seo_title: string,
  headline: string,
  hero_image: string,
}

const fields = pageData.fields as Fields;
---
<html>
  <title>{fields.seo_title}</title>
  <body>
    <h1>{fields.headline}</h1>
    <img src={fields.hero_image} />
  </body>
</html>
```
