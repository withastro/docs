[PayloadCMS](https://payloadcms.com/) is a headless open-source content management system that can be used to provide content for your Astro project.

## Integrating with Astro

### Prerequisites


1. **An Astro project** - If you don't have an Astro project yet, our [Installation guide](/en/install/auto/) will get you up and running in no time.
2. **A MongoDB database** - PayloadCMS will ask you for a MongoDB connection string when creating a new project. You can set one up locally or use [MongoDBAtlas](https://www.mongodb.com/) to host a database on the web for free.
3. **A PayloadCMS REST API** - Create a [PayloadCMS](https://payloadcms.com/docs/getting-started/installation) project and connect it to your MongoDB database during the setup.

:::note[Choosing a template]
During the PayloadCMS installation, you will be asked if you want to use a template.

Choosing any of the available templates at this step (such as 'blog') automatically generates additional collections for you to use. Otherwise, you will need to manually create your PayloadCMS collections.
:::

### Configuring Astro for your PayloadCMS collection

Your Payload project template will contain a file called Posts.ts in `src/collections/`. If you did not choose a template during installation that created a content collection for you, you can create a new Payload CMS Collection by adding this configuration file manually. The example below shows this file for a collection called `posts` that requires `title`, `content`, and `slug` fields:


```astro title="src/collections/Posts.ts"
import { CollectionConfig } from "payload/types";

const Posts: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: "posts",
  admin: {
    useAsTitle: "title",
  },
  access: {
    read: () => true,
  },

  fields: [
    {
      name: "title",
      type: "text",
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "content",
      type: "text",
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "slug",
      type: "text",
      required: true,
    },
  ],
};

export default Posts;
```

1. Import and add both `Users` (available in all PayloadCMS projects) and any other collections (e.g. `Posts`) to the available collections in the `payload.config.ts` file.

    ```astro title="src/payload.config.ts" ins={4, 5, 12}
    import { buildConfig } from "payload/config";
    import path from "path";

    import Users from "./collections/Users";
    import Posts from "./collections/Posts";

    export default buildConfig({
      serverURL: "http://localhost:4321",
      admin: {
        user: Users.slug,
      },
      collections: [Users, Posts],
      typescript: {
        outputFile: path.resolve(__dirname, "payload-types.ts"),
      },
      graphQL: {
        schemaOutputFile: path.resolve(__dirname, "generated-schema.graphql"),
      },
    });
    ```

    This will make a new collection called "Posts" appear in your PayloadCMS Dashboard next to the "Users" collection. 

2. Enter the "Posts" collection and create a new post. After saving it, you will notice the API URL appear in the bottom right corner.

3. With the dev server running, open `http://localhost:4321/api/posts` in your browser. You should see a JSON file containing the post you have created as an object.

    ```json
    {
      "docs":[
          {
            "id":"64098b16483b0f06a7e20ed4",
            "title":"Astro & PayloadCMS Title 🚀",
            "content":"Astro & PayloadCMS Content",
            "slug":"astro-payloadcms-slug",
            "createdAt":"2023-03-09T07:30:30.837Z",
            "updatedAt":"2023-03-09T07:30:30.837Z"
          }
      ],
      "totalDocs":1,
      "limit":10,
      "totalPages":1,
      "page":1,
      "pagingCounter":1,
      "hasPrevPage":false,
      "hasNextPage":false,
      "prevPage":null,
      "nextPage":null
    }
    ```

:::tip
By default, both Astro and PayloadCMS will use port 4321. You might want to change the PayloadCMS port in the `src/server.ts` file. Don't forget to update the `serverURL` in `src/payload.config.ts` as well.
:::

### Fetching Data

Fetch your PayloadCMS data through your site's unique REST API URL and the route for your content. (By default, PayloadCMS will mount all routes through `/api`.) Then, you can render your data properties using Astro's `set:html=""` directive.

Together with your post, PayloadCMS will return some top-level metadata. The actual documents are nested within the `docs` array.

For example, to display a list of post titles and their content:

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
---
import HomeLayout from "../layouts/HomeLayout.astro";

const res = await fetch("http://localhost:5000/api/posts") // http://localhost:4321/api/posts by default
const posts = await res.json()
---

<HomeLayout title='Astro Blog'>
	{
    posts.docs.map((post) => (
        <h2 set:html={post.title} />
        <p set:html={post.content} />
    ))
	}
</HomeLayout>
```

## Building a blog with PayloadCMS and Astro

Create a blog index page `src/pages/index.astro` to list each of your posts with a link to its own page.

Fetching via the API returns an array of objects (posts) that include, among others, the following properties:

- `title`
- `content`
- `slug`

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
---
import HomeLayout from "../layouts/HomeLayout.astro";

const res = await fetch("http://localhost:5000/api/posts") // http://localhost:4321/api/posts by default
const posts = await res.json()
---

<HomeLayout title='Astro Blog'>
	<h1>Astro + PayloadCMS 🚀</h1>
	<h2>Blog posts list:</h2>
	<ul>
		{
			posts.docs.map((post) =>(
				<li>
					<a href={`posts/${post.slug}`} set:html={post.title} />
				</li>
			))
		}
	</ul>
</HomeLayout>
```

### Using the PayloadCMS API to generate pages

Create a page `src/pages/posts/[slug].astro` to [dynamically generate a page](/en/core-concepts/routing/#dynamic-routes) for each post.

```astro title="src/pages/posts/[slug].astro"
---
import PostLayout from "../../layouts/PostLayout.astro"

const {title, content} = Astro.props

// The getStaticPaths() is required for static Astro sites.
// If using an on-demand rendering mode, you will not need this function.
export async function getStaticPaths() {
    let data = await fetch("http://localhost:5000/api/posts")
    let posts = await data.json()

    return posts.docs.map((post) => {
        return {
            params: {slug: post.slug},
            props: {title: post.title, content: post.content},
        };
    });
} 
---
<PostLayout title={title}>
    <article>
        <h1 set:html={title} />
        <p set:html={content} />
    </article>
</PostLayout>
```
