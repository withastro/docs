[Optimizely CMS](https://www.optimizely.com/products/content-management/) is an enterprise-grade CMS available as a fully flexible .NET PaaS solution or as a headless SaaS solution. You can connect either to be the headless CMS for an Astro website by using Optimizely's hosted GraphQL implementation (Called Optimizely Graph).

The SaaS CMS comes with deep Optimizely Graph integration already included and enabled which makes development easy for anyone familiar with GraphQL.
