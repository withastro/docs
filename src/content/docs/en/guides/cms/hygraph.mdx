[Hygraph](https://hygraph.com/) is a federated content management platform. It exposes a GraphQL endpoint for fetching content.

## Integrating with Astro

In this section, you'll create a [Hygraph](https://hygraph.com/) GraphQL endpoint to fetch with Astro.

### Prerequisites

To get started, you will need to have the following:

1. **A Hygraph account and project**. If you don't have an account, you can [sign up for free](https://app.hygraph.com/signup) and create a new project. 

2. **Hygraph access permissions** - In `Project Settings > API Access`, configure Public Content API permissions to allow read requests without authentication. If you haven't set any permissions, you can click **Yes, initialize defaults** to add the required permissions to use the "High Performance Content API".

### Setting up the endpoint

To add your Hygraph endpoint to Astro, create a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following variable:

```ini title=".env"
HYGRAPH_ENDPOINT=YOUR_HIGH_PERFORMANCE_API
```

Now, you should be able to use this environment variable in your project. 

If you would like to have IntelliSense for your environment variables, you can create a `env.d.ts` file in the `src/` directory and configure `ImportMetaEnv` like this:

```ts title="src/env.d.ts"
interface ImportMetaEnv {
  readonly HYGRAPH_ENDPOINT: string;
}
```

:::note
Read more about [using environment variables](/en/guides/environment-variables/) and `.env` files in Astro.
:::

Your root directory should now include these new files:

<FileTree title="Project Structure">
- src/
  - **env.d.ts**
- **.env**
- astro.config.mjs
- package.json
</FileTree>

### Fetching data

Fetch data from your Hygraph project by using the `HYGRAPH_ENDPOINT`. 

For example, to fetch entries of a `blogPosts` content type that has a string field `title`, create a GraphQL query to fetch that content. Then, define the type of the content, and set it as the type of the response.

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
---
interface Post {
	title: string;
}

const query = {
	method: "POST",
	headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
	body: JSON.stringify({
		query: `
      {
        blogPosts {
          title
        }
      }`,
	}),
};

const response = await fetch(import.meta.env.HYGRAPH_ENDPOINT, query);
const json = await response.json();
const posts: Post[] = json.data.blogPosts;
---

<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8" />
		<link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
		<meta name="generator" content={Astro.generator} />
		<title>Astro</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Astro</h1>
		{
			posts.map((post) => (
				<div>
					<h2>{post.title}</h2>
				</div>
			))
		}
	</body>
</html>
```

## Deploy

### Configuring Netlify Webhook

To set up a webhook in Netlify:

1. Deploy your site to Netlify with [this guide](/en/guides/deploy/netlify/). Remember to add your `HYGRAPH_ENDPOINT` to the enviroment variables.

2. Then Go to your Hygraph project dashboard and click on **Apps**. 

3. Go to the marketplace and search for Netlify and follow the instructions provided.

4. If all went good, now you can deploy your website with a click in the Hygraph interface.
