[JekyllPad](https://www.jekyllpad.com) is a lightweight, browser-based CMS that connects directly to your GitHub repository. 

It provides a modern WYSIWYG + Markdown editor, commits changes straight to your repo, and runs 100% client‑side, so you can manage content for Astro without setting up servers or learning Git.

It is a client-side application that runs completely in user's browser. This means data, oauth and security tokens, all stays in user's browser. No installation required, works with any mobile or desktop browsers.
