Astro allows you to choose **on-demand rendering** for some, or all of your pages and endpoints. This is also known as **server-side rendering (SSR)**: generating HTML pages on the server when requested and sending them to the client. An **adapter** is used to run your project on the server and handle these requests.

This on-demand rendering allows you to:
- Implement sessions for login state in your app.
- Render data from an API called dynamically with `fetch()`.
- Deploy your site to a host using an *adapter*.

Consider enabling on-demand server rendering in your Astro project if you need the following:

- **API endpoints**: Create specific pages that function as API endpoints for tasks like database access, authentication, and authorization while keeping sensitive data hidden from the client.

- **Protected pages**: Restrict access to a page based on user privileges, by handling user access on the server.

- **Frequently changing content**: Generate individual pages without requiring a static rebuild of your site. This is useful when the content of a page updates frequently.

## Enable on-demand server rendering

Both of Astro's on-demand rendering output modes (`server` and `hybrid`) allow you to take advantage of static site performance by pre-rendering individual routes whenever possible, whether you have an entirely dynamic app or a mostly static site that needs on-demand rendering only for select routes.

To decide which one to use in your project, choose the `output` option that represents how **most** of your pages and routes will be rendered:

- __`output: 'server'`__: On-demand rendered by default. Use this when most or all of your site or app should be server-rendered on request. Any individual page or endpoint can *opt-in* to pre-rendering.
- __`output: 'hybrid'`__: Pre-rendered to HTML by default. Use this when most of your site should be static. Any individual page or endpoint can *opt-out* of pre-rendering.
 
Because the server will need to generate at least some pages on demand, both of these modes require you to [add an adapter](#add-an-adapter) to carry out the server functions.

### Configure `server` or `hybrid`

To enable on-demand rendering, first update your `output` configuration to one of the two server-rendered modes.

For example, to configure a highly dynamic app where every page is rendered on demand by default, add `output: 'server'` to your Astro config: 

```js ins={5} title="astro.config.mjs"
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import nodejs from '@astrojs/nodejs';

export default defineConfig({
  output: 'server',
});
```

You can then choose to override the default on-demand rendering of `server` mode on any page or route by exporting `const prerender = true`:

```astro title="src/pages/my-static-page.astro" ins={2}
---
export const prerender = true;
// ...
---
<html>
  <!-- Static, pre-rendered page here... -->
</html>
```

### Opting-in to pre-rendering in `server` mode

For a mostly server-rendered app configured as `output: server`, add `export const prerender = true` to any page or route to pre-render a static page or endpoint:

```astro title="src/pages/mypage.astro" {2}
---
export const prerender = true;
// ...
---
<html>
  <!-- Static, pre-rendered page here... -->
</html>
```

```mdx title="src/pages/mypage.mdx" {5}
---
layout: '../layouts/markdown.astro'
title: 'My page'
---
export const prerender = true;

# This is my static, pre-rendered page
```

```js title="src/pages/myendpoint.js" {1}
export const prerender = true;

export async function GET() {
  return {
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: `This is my static endpoint` }),
  };
}
```

### Opting out of pre-rendering in `hybrid` mode

For a mostly static site configured as `output: hybrid`, add `export const prerender = false` to any files that should be server-rendered on demand:

```js title="src/pages/randomnumber.js" {1}
export const prerender = false;

export async function GET() {
  let number = Math.random();
  return {
    body: JSON.stringify({ number, message: `Here's a random number: ${number}` }),
  };
}
```

### Add an Adapter

To deploy a project in `server` or `hybrid` mode, you also need to add an **adapter**. This is because both of these modes require a server _runtime_: the environment that runs code on the server to generate pages when they are requested. Each adapter allows Astro to output a script that runs your project on a specific runtime, such as Vercel, Netlify or Cloudflare.

You can find both [official and community adapters in our integrations directory](https://astro.build/integrations/?search=&categories%5B%5D=adapters). Choose the one that corresponds to your [deployment environment](/en/guides/deploy/).

#### `astro add` Install

You can add any of the [official adapters maintained by Astro](/en/guides/integrations-guide/#official-integrations) with the following `astro add` command. This will install the adapter and make the appropriate changes to your `astro.config.mjs` file in one step. 

For example, to install the Vercel adapter, run:

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```shell
  npx astro add vercel
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```shell
  pnpm astro add vercel
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```shell
  yarn astro add vercel
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

#### Manual Install

You can also add an adapter manually by installing the package and updating `astro.config.mjs` yourself.

For example, to install the Vercel adapter manually:

1. Install the adapter to your project dependencies using your preferred package manager:

   <PackageManagerTabs>
     <Fragment slot="npm">
     ```shell
     npm install @astrojs/vercel
     ```
     </Fragment>
     <Fragment slot="pnpm">
     ```shell
     pnpm install @astrojs/vercel
     ```
     </Fragment>
     <Fragment slot="yarn">
     ```shell
     yarn add @astrojs/vercel
     ```
     </Fragment>
   </PackageManagerTabs>

2. [Add the adapter](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#adapter) to your `astro.config.mjs` file's import and default export, along with your desired `output` mode:

    ```js ins={3,7} {6}
    // astro.config.mjs
    import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
    import vercel from '@astrojs/vercel';

    export default defineConfig({
      output: 'server',
      adapter: vercel(),
    });
    ```

    Note that different adapters may also have different configuration settings. Read each adapter's documentation, and apply any necessary config options to your chosen adapter in `astro.config.mjs`

## On-demand rendering features

### HTML streaming

With HTML streaming, a document is broken up into chunks, sent over the network in order, and rendered on the page in that order. In `server` or `hybrid` mode, Astro uses HTML streaming to send each component to the browser as it renders them. This makes sure the user sees your HTML as fast as possible, although network conditions can cause large documents to be downloaded slowly, and waiting for data fetches can block page rendering.

<RecipeLinks slugs={["en/recipes/streaming-improve-page-performance"]}/>

:::caution[HTML streaming]
Features that modify the [Response headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header) are only available at the **page level** when HTML streaming is enabled. (You can't use them inside of components, including layout components.) By the time Astro runs your component code, it has already sent the Response headers and they cannot be modified.

Check your adapter's documentation to see whether HTML streaming is used. It may be the default setting, and may or may not be a configurable option.
:::

### Cookies

In `server` and `hybrid` modes, a page or API endpoint can check, set, get, and delete cookies.

The example below updates the value of a cookie for a page view counter:

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" {4,5,9}
---
let counter = 0

if (Astro.cookies.has("counter")) {
  const cookie = Astro.cookies.get("counter")
	counter = cookie.number() + 1
}

Astro.cookies.set("counter",counter)
---
<html>
  <h1>Counter = {counter}</h1>
</html>
```

See more details about [`Astro.cookies` and the `AstroCookie` type](/en/reference/api-reference/#astrocookies) in the API reference.

### `Response`

You can also return a [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) from any page using on-demand rendering. 

The example below returns a 404 on a dynamic page after looking up an id in the database:

```astro title="src/pages/[id].astro" {8-11}
---
import { getProduct } from '../api';

const product = await getProduct(Astro.params.id);

// No product found
if (!product) {
  return new Response(null, {
    status: 404,
    statusText: 'Not found'
  });
}
---
<html>
  <!-- Page here... -->
</html>
```

### `Request`

`Astro.request` is a standard [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) object. It can be used to get the `url`, `headers`, `method`, and even body of the request.

In both `server` and `hybrid` mode, you can access additional information from this object for pages that are not statically-generated.

#### `Astro.request.headers`

The headers for the request are available on `Astro.request.headers`. This works like the browser's [`Request.headers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/headers). It is a [Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers) object where you can retrieve headers such as the cookie.

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" {2}
---
const cookie = Astro.request.headers.get('cookie');
// ...
---
<html>
  <!-- Page here... -->
</html>
```

#### `Astro.request.method`

The HTTP method used in the request is available as `Astro.request.method`. This works like the browser's [`Request.method`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/method). It returns the string representation of the HTTP method used in the request.

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
---
console.log(Astro.request.method) // GET (when navigated to in the browser)
---
```

See more details about [`Astro.request`](/en/reference/api-reference/#astrorequest) in the API reference.

### Server Endpoints

A server endpoint, also known as an **API route**, is a special function exported from a `.js` or `.ts` file within the `src/pages/` folder. A powerful feature of server-side rendering on demand, API routes are able to securely execute code on the server.

The function takes an [endpoint context](/en/reference/api-reference/#endpoint-context) and returns a [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response).
