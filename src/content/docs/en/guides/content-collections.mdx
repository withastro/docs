**Content collections** are the best way to manage sets of content in any Astro project. Collections help to organize and query your documents, enable Intellisense and type checking in your editor, and provide automatic TypeScript type-safety for all of your content.

Astro provides performant, scalable APIs to load, query, and render content from anywhere: stored locally in your project, hosted remotely, or fetched live from frequently-updating sources.

## What are Content Collections?

A content collection is a set of related, structurally-identical data. This data can be stored in one or several files locally (e.g. a folder of individual Markdown files of blog posts, a single JSON file of product descriptions) or fetched from remote sources such as a database, CMS or API endpoint. Each member of the collection is called an entry.

Collections are defined by the location and shape of this data and provide a convenient way to query and render your content. Two [types of content collections](#types-of-collections) are available to allow you to work with data fetched at build time or at request time. Both build-time collections and live updating collections use:

- A required `loader` to retrieve your content and metadata from wherever it is stored and make it available to your project through content-focused APIs.
- An optional collection `schema` that allows you to define the expected shape of each entry for type safety, autocomplete, and validation in your editor.

Collections stored locally in your project or on your filesystem can use one of Astro's [built-in build-time loaders](#build-time-collection-loaders) to fetch data from Markdown, MDX, Markdoc, YAML, TOML, or JSON files. Point Astro to the location of your content, define your data shape, and you're good to go with a blog or similarly content-heavy, mostly static site in no time!

With [community-built loaders](https://astro.build/integrations/?search=&categories%5B%5D=loaders) or by building a [custom build-time collection loader](#custom-build-time-loaders) or [live loader](#creating-a-live-loader) yourself, you can fetch remote data from any external source, such as a CMS, database, or headless payment system, either at build time or live on demand.

### When to create a collection

You can create a collection any time you have a group of related data or content, stored in the same location, that shares a common structure:

<FileTree>
- src/
- **newsletter/** the "newsletter" collection
  - week-1.md a collection entry
  - week-2.md a collection entry
  - week-3.md a collection entry
- **authors/** the "author" collection
  - authors.json a single file containing all collection entries
</FileTree>

Define your data as a collection when:

- You have multiple files or data to organize that share the same overall structure (e.g. a directory of blog posts written in Markdown which all have the same frontmatter properties).
- You have existing content stored remotely, such as in a CMS, and want to take advantage of the collections helper functions instead of using `fetch()` or SDKs.
- You need to fetch (tens of) thousands of related pieces of data at build time, and need a querying and caching method that handles at scale.

Much of the benefit of using collections comes from:

- Defining a common data shape to validate that an individual entry is "correct" or "complete", avoiding errors in production.
- Content-focused APIs designed to make querying intuitive (e.g. `getCollection()` instead of `import.meta.glob()`) when importing and rendering content on your pages.
- Access to both built-in loaders and access to the low-level [Content Loader API](/en/reference/content-loader-reference/) for retrieving your content. There are additionally several third-party and community-built loaders available, and you can build your own custom loader to fetch data from anywhere.
- Performance and scalability. Build-time content collections data can be cached between builds and is suitable for tens of thousands of content entries.

### When not to create a collection

Collections provide excellent structure, safety, and organization when you have **multiple pieces of content that must share the same properties**.

Collections **may not be your solution** if:

- You have only one or a small number of different content pages. Consider [making individual page components](/en/basics/astro-pages/) such as `src/pages/about.astro` with your content directly instead.
- You are displaying files that are not processed by Astro, such as PDFs. Place these static assets in the [`public/` directory](/en/basics/project-structure/#public) of your project instead.
- Your data source has its own SDK/client library for imports that is incompatible with or does not offer a content loader and you prefer to use it directly.

## Types of collections

**[Build-time content collections](#build-time-content-collections)** are updated at build time and data is saved to a storage layer. This provides excellent performance for most content, but may not be suitable for frequently updating data sources requiring up-to-the-moment data freshness such as live stock prices.

For the best performance and scalability, use build-time content collections when one or more of these is true:

- **Performance is critical** and you want to prerender data at build time.
- **Your data is relatively static** (e.g., blog posts, documentation, product descriptions).
- **You want to benefit from build-time optimization** and caching.
- **You need to process MDX** or **perform image optimization**.
- **Your data can be fetched once and reused** across multiple builds.

:::

**[Live content collections](#live-content-collections)** fetch their data at runtime rather than build time. This allows you to access frequently updated data from CMSs, APIs, databases, or other sources using a unified API, without needing to rebuild your site when the data changes. However, this can come at a performance cost since data is fetched at each request and returned directly with no data store persistence.

Live content collections are designed for data that changes frequently and needs to be up-to-date when a page is requested. Consider using them when one or more of these is true:

- **You need real-time information** (e.g. user-specific data, current stock levels).
- **You want to avoid constant rebuilds** for content that changes often.
- **Your data updates frequently** (e.g. up-to-the-minute product inventory, prices, availability).
- **You need to pass dynamic filters** to your data source based on user input or request parameters.
- **You're building preview functionality** for a CMS where editors need to see draft content immediately.

See the [limitations of experimental live collections](#live-collection-limitations) and [key differences from build-time collections](#differences-from-build-time-collections) for more details on choosing between live and preloaded collections.

We suggest using build-time content collections whenever possible, and using live collections when your content needs updating in real time and the performance tradeoffs are acceptable.

Both kinds of collections can exist in the same project, so you can always choose the best type of collection for each individual data source. For example, a build-time collection can manage product descriptions, while a live collection can manage content inventory.

Both types of collections use similar APIs (e.g. `getCollection()` and `getLiveCollection()`) so that working with collections will feel familiar no matter which one you choose, while still ensuring that you always know which type of collection you are working with.

## TypeScript configuration for collections

Content collections rely on TypeScript to provide Zod validation, Intellisense and type checking in your editor. If you are not extending one of Astro's  `strict` or `strictest` TypeScript settings, you will need to ensure the following `compilerOptions` are set in your `tsconfig.json`:

```json title="tsconfig.json" ins={5} {6}
{
  // Included with "astro/tsconfigs/strict" or "astro/tsconfigs/strictest"
  "extends": "astro/tsconfigs/base",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strictNullChecks": true, // add if using `base` template
    "allowJs": true // required, and included with all Astro templates
  }
}
```

## Build-time content collections

All of your build-time content collections are defined in a special `src/content.config.ts` file (`.js` and `.mjs` extensions are also supported) using `defineCollection()` and then a single collections object is exported for use in your project.

Each individual collection configures:
- [a build-time `loader`](#build-time-collection-loaders) for a data source (required)
- [a build-time `schema`](#defining-the-collection-schema) for type safety (optional, but highly recommended!)

```ts title="src/content.config.ts"
// 1. Import utilities from `astro:content`
import { defineCollection, z } from 'astro:content';

// 2. Import loader(s)
import { glob } from 'astro/loaders';

// 3. Define a `loader` and `schema` for each collection
const blog = defineCollection({
  loader: glob({ base: './src/content/blog', pattern: '**/*.{md,mdx}' }),
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    description: z.string(),
    pubDate: z.coerce.date(),
    updatedDate: z.coerce.date().optional(),
  }),
});

// 4. Export a single `collections` object to register your collection(s)
export const collections = { blog };
```

You can then use the dedicated `getCollection()` and `getEntry()` functions to [query your content collections data](#querying-build-time-collections) and render your content.

You can choose to [generate page routes](#generating-routes-from-content) from your build-time collection entries at build time for an entirely static, prerendered site. Or, you can render your build-time collections on demand, choosing to delay building your page until it is first requested. This is useful when you have a large number of pages (e.g. thousands, or tens of thousands) and want to delay building a static page until it is needed.

### Build time collection loaders

A loader allows you to fetch your content collections data, whether stored locally in your project or remotely.

Astro provides two built-in loader functions (`glob()` and `file()`) for fetching your local content at build time, as well as access to the [Content Loader API](/en/reference/content-loader-reference/) to construct your own loaders to fetch remote data.

#### The `glob()` loader

The [`glob()` loader](/en/reference/content-loader-reference/#glob-loader) creates entries from directories of Markdown, MDX, Markdoc, JSON, YAML, or TOML files from anywhere on the filesystem. If you store your content locally, such as a directory of blog posts, then the `glob()` loader is all you need to access your content.

This loader accepts a `pattern` of entry files to match using glob patterns supported by [micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch#matching-features), and a base file path of where your files are located. Each entry's `id` will be automatically generated from its file name. Use this loader when each entry in your content collection is its own single file.

```ts  title="src/content.config.ts" {5,9}
import { defineCollection, z } from 'astro:content';
import { glob, file } from 'astro/loaders';

const blog = defineCollection({
  loader: glob({ pattern: "**/*.md", base: "./src/data/blog" }),
  schema: /* ... */
});

export const collections = { blog };
```

#### The `file()` loader

The [`file()` loader](/en/reference/content-loader-reference/#file-loader) creates multiple entries from a single local file. This is useful if your content is stored as multiple objects within a single JSON or TOML file.

Each entry in the file must have a unique `id` key property. It accepts a `base` file path to your file and optionally a [`parser` function](#parser-function) for data files it cannot parse automatically. Use this loader when your data file can be parsed as an array of objects.

```ts  title="src/content.config.ts"
import { defineCollection, z } from 'astro:content';
import { file } from 'astro/loaders';

const dogs = defineCollection({
  loader: file("src/data/dogs.json"),
  schema: /* ... */
});

export const collections = { dogs };
```

##### `parser` function

The `file()` loader accepts a second argument that defines a `parser` function. This allows you to specify a custom parser (e.g. `csv-parse`) to create a collection from a file's contents.

The `file()` loader will automatically detect and parse (based on their file extension) a single array of objects from JSON and YAML files, and will treat each top-level table as an independent entry in TOML files. Support for these file types is built-in, and there is no need for a `parser` unless you have a [nested JSON document](#nested-json-documents). To use other files, such as `.csv`, you will need to create a parser function.

The following example shows importing a CSV parser, then loading a `cats` collection into your project by passing both a file path and `parser` function to the `file()` loader:

```typescript title="src/content.config.ts"
import { defineCollection } from "astro:content";
import { file } from "astro/loaders";
import { parse as parseCsv } from "csv-parse/sync";

const cats = defineCollection({
  loader: file("src/data/cats.csv", { parser: (text) => parseCsv(text, { columns: true, skipEmptyLines: true })})
});
```

###### Nested `.json` documents

The `parser` argument also allows you to load a single collection from a nested JSON document. For example, this JSON file contains multiple collections:

```json title="src/data/pets.json"
{"dogs": [{}], "cats": [{}]}
```

You can separate these collections by passing a custom `parser` to the `file()` loader for each collection:

```typescript title="src/content.config.ts"
const dogs = defineCollection({
  loader: file("src/data/pets.json", { parser: (text) => JSON.parse(text).dogs })
});
const cats = defineCollection({
  loader: file("src/data/pets.json", { parser: (text) => JSON.parse(text).cats })
});
```

#### Custom build-time loaders

You can build a custom loader to fetch remote content from any data source, such as a CMS, a database, or an API endpoint.

Using a loader to fetch your data will automatically create a collection from your remote data. This gives you all the benefits of local collections, such as collection-specific API helpers such as `getCollection()` and `render()` to [query and display your data](#querying-build-time-collections), as well as schema validation.

:::tip
Find community-built and third-party loaders in the [Astro integrations directory](https://astro.build/integrations/?search=&categories%5B%5D=loaders).
:::

##### Inline build-time loaders

You can define a loader inline, inside your collection, as an async function that returns an array of entries.

This is useful for loaders that don't need to manually control how the data is loaded and stored. Whenever the loader is called, it will clear the store and reload all the entries.

```ts title="src/content.config.ts"
const countries = defineCollection({
  loader: async () => {
    const response = await fetch("https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all");
    const data = await response.json();
    // Must return an array of entries with an id property, or an object with IDs as keys and entries as values
    return data.map((country) => ({
      id: country.cca3,
      ...country,
    }));
  },
  schema: /* ... */
});
```

The returned entries are stored in the collection and can be queried using the `getCollection()` and `getEntry()` functions.

##### Loader objects

For more control over the loading process, you can use the Content Loader API to create a [loader object](/en/reference/content-loader-reference/#object-loaders). For example, with access to the `load` method directly, you can create a loader that allows entries to be updated incrementally or clears the store only when necessary.

Similar to creating an Astro integration or Vite plugin, you can [distribute your loader as an npm package](/en/reference/publish-to-npm/) that others can use in their projects.

<ReadMore>See the full [Content Loader API](/en/reference/content-loader-reference/) and examples of how to build your own loader.</ReadMore>

### Defining the collection schema

Schemas enforce consistent frontmatter or entry data within a collection through Zod validation. A schema **guarantees** that this data exists in a predictable form when you need to reference or query it. If any file violates its collection schema, Astro will provide a helpful error to let you know.

Schemas also power Astro's automatic TypeScript typings for your content. When you define a schema for your collection, Astro will automatically generate and apply a TypeScript interface to it. The result is full TypeScript support when you query your collection, including property autocompletion and type-checking.

:::tip
In order for Astro to recognize a new or updated schema, you may need to restart the dev server or [sync the content layer](/en/reference/cli-reference/#astro-dev) (<code>s + enter</code>) to define the `astro:content` module.
:::

Every frontmatter or data property of your collection entries must be defined using a Zod data type:

```ts title="src/content.config.ts" {6-11,15-19}
import { defineCollection, z } from 'astro:content';
import { glob, file } from 'astro/loaders';

const blog = defineCollection({
  loader: glob({ pattern: "**/*.md", base: "./src/data/blog" }),
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    description: z.string(),
    pubDate: z.coerce.date(),
    updatedDate: z.coerce.date().optional(),
  })
});
const dogs = defineCollection({
  loader: file("src/data/dogs.json"),
  schema: z.object({
    id: z.string(),
    breed: z.string(),
    temperament: z.array(z.string()),
  }),
});

export const collections = { blog, dogs };
```

#### Defining datatypes with Zod

Astro uses [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) to power its content schemas. With Zod, Astro is able to validate every file's data within a collection *and* provide automatic TypeScript types when you go to query content from inside your project.

To use Zod in Astro, import the `z` utility from `"astro:content"`. This is a re-export of the Zod library, and it supports all of the features of Zod 3.

```ts
// Example: A cheatsheet of many common Zod datatypes
import { z, defineCollection } from 'astro:content';

defineCollection({
  schema: z.object({
    isDraft: z.boolean(),
    title: z.string(),
    sortOrder: z.number(),
    image: z.object({
      src: z.string(),
      alt: z.string(),
    }),
    author: z.string().default('Anonymous'),
    language: z.enum(['en', 'es']),
    tags: z.array(z.string()),
    footnote: z.string().optional(),

    // In YAML, dates written without quotes around them are interpreted as Date objects
    publishDate: z.date(), // e.g. 2024-09-17

    // Transform a date string (e.g. "2022-07-08") to a Date object
    updatedDate: z.string().transform((str) => new Date(str)),

    authorContact: z.string().email(),
    canonicalURL: z.string().url(),
  })
})
```

##### Zod schema methods

All [Zod schema methods](https://zod.dev/?id=schema-methods) (e.g. `.parse()`, `.transform()`) are available, with some limitations. Notably, performing custom validation checks on images using `image().refine()` is unsupported.

#### Defining collection references

Collection entries can also "reference" other related entries. 

With the [`reference()` function](/en/reference/modules/astro-content/#reference), you can define a property in a collection schema as an entry from another collection. For example, you can require that every `space-shuttle` entry includes a `pilot` property which uses the `pilot` collection's own schema for type checking, autocomplete, and validation.

A common example is a blog post that references reusable author profiles stored as JSON, or related post URLs stored in the same collection:

```ts title="src/content.config.ts"
import { defineCollection, reference, z } from 'astro:content';
import { glob } from 'astro/loaders';

const blog = defineCollection({
  loader: glob({ base: './src/content/blog', pattern: '**/*.{md,mdx}' }),
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    // Reference a single author from the `authors` collection by `id`
    author: reference('authors'),
    // Reference an array of related posts from the `blog` collection by `id`
    relatedPosts: z.array(reference('blog')),
  })
});

const authors = defineCollection({
  loader: glob({ pattern: '**/*.json', base: "./src/data/authors" }),
  schema: z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    portfolio: z.string().url(),
  })
});

export const collections = { blog, authors };
```

This example blog post specifies the `id`s of related posts and the `id` of the post author:

```yaml title="src/data/blog/welcome.md"
---
title: "Welcome to my blog"
author: ben-holmes # references `src/data/authors/ben-holmes.json` 
relatedPosts:
- about-me # references `src/data/blog/about-me.md`
- my-year-in-review # references `src/data/blog/my-year-in-review.md`
---
```

These references will be transformed into objects containing a `collection` key and an `id` key, allowing you to easily [query them in your templates](/en/guides/content-collections/#accessing-referenced-data).

#### Defining custom IDs

When using the [`glob()` loader](#the-glob-loader) with Markdown, MDX, Markdoc, JSON, or TOML files, every content entry [`id`](/en/reference/modules/astro-content/#id) is automatically generated in an URL-friendly format based on the content filename. The `id` is used to query the entry directly from your collection. It is also useful when [creating new pages and URLs from your content](#generating-routes-from-content).

You can override an entry’s generated `id` by adding your own `slug` property to the file frontmatter or data object for JSON files. This is similar to the “permalink” feature of other web frameworks.

```md title="src/blog/1.md" {3}
---
title: My Blog Post
slug: my-custom-id/supports/slashes
---
Your blog post content here.
```

```json title="src/categories/1.json" {3}
{
  "title": "My Category",
  "slug": "my-custom-id/supports/slashes",
  "description": "Your category description here."
}
```

### Querying build-time collections

Astro provides helper functions to query a collection and return one (or more) content entries.

- [`getCollection()`](/en/reference/modules/astro-content/#getcollection) fetches an entire collection and returns an array of entries.
- [`getEntry()`](/en/reference/modules/astro-content/#getentry) fetches a single entry from a collection.

These return entries with a unique `id`, a `data` object with all defined properties, and will also return a `body` containing the raw, uncompiled body of a Markdown, MDX, or Markdoc document.

```js
import { getCollection, getEntry } from 'astro:content';

// Get all entries from a collection.
// Requires the name of the collection as an argument.
const allBlogPosts = await getCollection('blog');

// Get a single entry from a collection.
// Requires the name of the collection and `id`
const poodleData = await getEntry('dogs', 'poodle');


```

The sort order of generated collections is non-deterministic and platform-dependent. This means that if you are calling `getCollection()` and need your entries returned in a specific order (e.g. blog posts sorted by date), you must sort the collection entries yourself:

```astro title="src/pages/blog.astro"
---
import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';

const posts = (await getCollection('blog')).sort(
  (a, b) => b.data.pubDate.valueOf() - a.data.pubDate.valueOf(),
);
---
```

<ReadMore>See the full list of properties returned by the [`CollectionEntry` type](/en/reference/modules/astro-content/#collectionentry).</ReadMore>

#### Using content in Astro templates

After querying your collections, you can access each entry's content directly inside of your Astro component template. For example, you can create a list of links to your blog posts, displaying information from your entry's frontmatter using the `data` property.


```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
---
import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';
const posts = await getCollection('blog');
---
<h1>My posts</h1>
<ul>
  {posts.map(post => (
    <li><a href={`/blog/${post.id}`}>{post.data.title}</a></li>
  ))}
</ul>
```
#### Rendering body content 

Once queried, you can render Markdown and MDX entries to HTML using the [`render()`](/en/reference/modules/astro-content/#render) function property. Calling this function gives you access to rendered HTML content, including both a `<Content />` component and a list of all rendered headings.

```astro title="src/pages/blog/post-1.astro" {5,8}
---
import { getEntry, render } from 'astro:content';

const entry = await getEntry('blog', 'post-1');
if (!entry) {
  // Handle Error, for example:
  throw new Error('Could not find blog post 1');
}
const { Content, headings } = await render(entry);
---
<p>Published on: {entry.data.published.toDateString()}</p>
<Content />
```

<ReadMore>When working with MDX entries, you can also [pass your own components to `<Content />`](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/#passing-components-to-mdx-content) to replace HTML elements with custom alternatives.</ReadMore>

##### Passing content as props

A component can also pass an entire collection entry as a prop.

You can use the [`CollectionEntry`](/en/reference/modules/astro-content/#collectionentry) utility to correctly type your component's props using TypeScript. This utility takes a string argument that matches the name of your collection schema and will inherit all of the properties of that collection's schema.

```astro title="src/components/BlogCard.astro" /CollectionEntry(?:<.+>)?/
---
import type { CollectionEntry } from 'astro:content';
interface Props {
  post: CollectionEntry<'blog'>;
}

// `post` will match your 'blog' collection schema type
const { post } = Astro.props;
---
```

#### Filtering collection queries

`getCollection()` takes an optional "filter" callback that allows you to filter your query based on an entry's `id` or `data` properties.

You can use this to filter by any content criteria you like. For example, you can filter by properties like `draft` to prevent any draft blog posts from publishing to your blog:

```js
// Example: Filter out content entries with `draft: true`
import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';
const publishedBlogEntries = await getCollection('blog', ({ data }) => {
  return data.draft !== true;
});
```

You can also create draft pages that are available when running the dev server, but not built in production:

```js
// Example: Filter out content entries with `draft: true` only when building for production
import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';
const blogEntries = await getCollection('blog', ({ data }) => {
  return import.meta.env.PROD ? data.draft !== true : true;
});
```

The filter argument also supports filtering by nested directories within a collection. Since the `id` includes the full nested path, you can filter by the start of each `id` to only return items from a specific nested directory:

```js
// Example: Filter entries by sub-directory in the collection
import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';
const englishDocsEntries = await getCollection('docs', ({ id }) => {
  return id.startsWith('en/');
});
```

#### Accessing referenced data

Any [references defined in your schema](/en/guides/content-collections/#defining-collection-references) must be queried separately after first querying your collection entry. Since the [`reference()` function](/en/reference/modules/astro-content/#reference) transforms a reference to an object with `collection` and `id` as keys, you can use the `getEntry()` function to return a single referenced item, or `getEntries()` to retrieve multiple referenced entries from the returned `data` object.

```astro title="src/pages/blog/welcome.astro"
---
import { getEntry, getEntries } from 'astro:content';

const blogPost = await getEntry('blog', 'welcome');

// Resolve a singular reference (e.g. `{collection: "authors", id: "ben-holmes"}`)
const author = await getEntry(blogPost.data.author);
// Resolve an array of references
// (e.g. `[{collection: "blog", id: "about-me"}, {collection: "blog", id: "my-year-in-review"}]`)
const relatedPosts = await getEntries(blogPost.data.relatedPosts);
---

<h1>{blogPost.data.title}</h1>
<p>Author: {author.data.name}</p>

<!-- ... -->

<h2>You might also like:</h2>
{relatedPosts.map(post => (
  <a href={post.id}>{post.data.title}</a>
))}

## Live content collections 

Make sure you have an adapter configured for [on-demand rendering](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/), then define your live collections in `src/live.config.ts` (separate from your `src/content.config.ts` for build-time collections, if you have one).

Each individual collection configures:
- a [live `loader`](#creating-a-live-loader) for your data source, and optionally for type safety (required)
- a [live collection `schema`](#using-zod-schemas-with-live-collections) for type safety (optional)

Unlike for build-time collections, there are no built-in live loaders available. You will need to [create a custom live loader](#creating-a-live-loader) for your specific data source or find a third-party loader to pass to your live collection's `loader` property.

You can optionally [include type safety in your live loaders](#type-safety-in-live-loaders). Therefore, [defining a Zod `schema`](#using-zod-schemas-with-live-collections) for live collections is optional. However, if you provide one, it will take precedence over the live loader's types.

```ts title="src/live.config.ts"
// Define live collections for accessing real-time data
import { defineLiveCollection } from 'astro:content';
import { storeLoader } from '@mystore/astro-loader';

const products = defineLiveCollection({
  loader: storeLoader({
    apiKey: process.env.STORE_API_KEY,
    endpoint: 'https://api.mystore.com/v1',
  }),
});

export const collections = { products };
```

You can then use the dedicated `getLiveCollection()` and `getLiveEntry()` functions to [access your live data](#accessing-live-data) and render your content.

You can [generate page routes](#generating-routes-from-content) from your live collection entries on demand, fetching your data fresh at runtime upon each request without needing a rebuild of your site like [build-time collections](#build-time-content-collections) do. This is useful when accessing live, up-to-the-moment data is more important than achieving the performance of having your content available in a performant data storage layer that persists between site builds.

### Creating a live loader

A live loader is an object with two methods: `loadCollection()` and `loadEntry()`. These methods should handle errors gracefully and return either data or an [Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) object.

The standard pattern is to export a function that returns this loader object, allowing you to pass configuration options like API keys or endpoints.

Here's a basic example:

```ts title="myloader.ts"
import type { LiveLoader } from 'astro/loaders';
import { fetchFromCMS } from './cms-client.js';

interface Article {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  author: string;
}

export function articleLoader(config: { apiKey: string }): LiveLoader<Article> {
  return {
    name: 'article-loader',
    loadCollection: async ({ filter }) => {
      try {
        const articles = await fetchFromCMS({
          apiKey: config.apiKey,
          type: 'article',
          filter,
        });

        return {
          entries: articles.map((article) => ({
            id: article.id,
            data: article,
          })),
        };
      } catch (error) {
        return {
          error: new Error(`Failed to load articles: ${error.message}`),
        };
      }
    },
    loadEntry: async ({ filter }) => {
      try {
        // filter will be { id: "some-id" } when called with a string
        const article = await fetchFromCMS({
          apiKey: config.apiKey,
          type: 'article',
          id: filter.id,
        });

        if (!article) {
          return {
            error: new Error('Article not found'),
          };
        }

        return {
          id: article.id,
          data: article,
        };
      } catch (error) {
        return {
          error: new Error(`Failed to load article: ${error.message}`),
        };
      }
    },
  };
}
```

#### Providing rendered content

A loader can add support for directly rendered content by returning [a `rendered` property](/en/reference/content-loader-reference/#rendered) in the entry. This allows you to use [the `render()` function and `<Content />` component](/en/guides/content-collections/#rendering-body-content) to render the content directly in your pages.

If the loader does not return a `rendered` property for an entry, the `<Content />` component will render nothing.

```ts title="myloader.ts" {16-19}
// ...
export function articleLoader(config: { apiKey: string }): LiveLoader<Article> {
  return {
    name: 'article-loader',
    loadEntry: async ({ filter }) => {
      try {
        const article = await fetchFromCMS({
          apiKey: config.apiKey,
          type: 'article',
          id: filter.id,
        });

        return {
          id: article.id,
          data: article,
          rendered: {
            // Assuming the CMS returns HTML content
            html: article.htmlContent,
          },
        };
      } catch (error) {
        return {
          error: new Error(`Failed to load article: ${error.message}`),
        };
      }
    },
    // ...
  };
}
```

You can then [render both content and metadata from live collection entries](#rendering-content) in pages using the same method as built-time collections.

#### Error handling in live loaders

Loaders should handle all errors and return an [Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) subclass for errors. You can create [custom error types](#creating-live-loader-error-types) and use them for more specific error handling if needed. If an error is thrown in the loader, it will be caught and returned, wrapped in a `LiveCollectionError`.

Astro will generate some errors itself, depending on the response from the loader:

- If `loadEntry` returns `undefined`, Astro will return a `LiveEntryNotFoundError` to the user.
- If a schema is defined for the collection and the data does not match the schema, Astro will return a `LiveCollectionValidationError`.
- If the loader returns an invalid cache hint, Astro will return a `LiveCollectionCacheHintError`. The `cacheHint` field is optional, so if you do not have valid data to return, you can simply omit it.

```ts title="my-loader.ts" {9-11}
import type { LiveLoader } from 'astro/loaders';
import { MyLoaderError } from './errors.js';

export function myLoader(config): LiveLoader<MyData, undefined, undefined, MyLoaderError> {
  return {
    name: 'my-loader',
    loadCollection: async ({ filter }) => {
      // Return your custom error type
      return {
        error: new MyLoaderError('Failed to load', 'LOAD_ERROR'),
      };
    },
    // ...
  };
}
```

#### Type safety in live loaders

You can provide type safety for live collections by [using a Zod schema](#using-zod-schemas-with-live-collections) like you do in build-time collections. 

Live loaders can also provide their own type safety by passing generic types to the `LiveLoader` interface. You can [define the types](#defining-data-types) for your collection and entry data, as well as [custom filter types](#defining-custom-filter-types) for querying, and [custom error types](#creating-live-loader-error-types) for error handling in the live loader itself.

##### Defining data types

Like regular content collections, live collections can be typed to ensure type safety in your data. [Using Zod schemas](#using-zod-schemas-with-live-collections) is supported, but not required to define types for live collections. Unlike preloaded collections defined at build time, live loaders can instead choose to pass generic types to the `LiveLoader` interface.

You can define the types for your collection and entry data, as well as custom filter types for querying, and custom error types for error handling.

Live loaders can define types for the data they return. This allows TypeScript to provide type checking and autocompletion when working with the data in your components.

```ts title="store-loader.ts" "LiveLoader<Product>" "type Product"
import type { LiveLoader } from 'astro/loaders';
import { fetchProduct, fetchCategory, type Product } from './store-client';

export function storeLoader(): LiveLoader<Product> {
  // ...
}
```

When you use `getLiveCollection()` or `getLiveEntry()`, TypeScript will infer the types based on the loader's definition:

```astro
---
export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode

import { getLiveEntry } from 'astro:content';
const { entry: product } = await getLiveEntry('products', '123');
// TypeScript knows product.data is of type Product
console.log(product?.data.name);
---
```

##### Defining custom filter types

Live loaders can define custom filter types for both `getLiveCollection()` and `getLiveEntry()`. This enables type-safe querying that matches your API's capabilities, making it easier for users to discover available filters and ensure they are used correctly. If you include JSDoc comments in your filter types, the user will see these in their IDE as hints when using the loader.

```ts title="store-loader.ts" "EntryFilter, CollectionFilter" {6,8}
import type { LiveLoader } from 'astro/loaders';
import { fetchProduct, fetchCategory, type Product } from './store-client';

interface CollectionFilter {
  category?: string;
  /** Minimum price to filter products */
  minPrice?: number;
  /** Maximum price to filter products */
  maxPrice?: number;
}

interface EntryFilter {
  /** Alias for `sku` */
  id?: string;
  slug?: string;
  sku?: string;
}

export function productLoader(config: {
  apiKey: string;
  endpoint: string;
}): LiveLoader<Product, EntryFilter, CollectionFilter> {
  return {
    name: 'product-loader',
    loadCollection: async ({ filter }) => {
      // filter is typed as CollectionFilter
      const data = await fetchCategory({
        apiKey: config.apiKey,
        category: filter?.category ?? 'all',
        minPrice: filter?.minPrice,
        maxPrice: filter?.maxPrice,
      });

      return {
        entries: data.products.map((product) => ({
          id: product.sku,
          data: product,
        })),
      };
    },
    loadEntry: async ({ filter }) => {
      // filter is typed as EntryFilter | { id: string }
      const product = await fetchProduct({
        apiKey: config.apiKey,
        slug: filter.slug,
        sku: filter.sku || filter.id,
      });
      if (!product) {
        return {
          error: new Error('Product not found'),
        };
      }
      return {
        id: product.sku,
        entry: product,
      };
    },
  };
}
```

##### Creating live loader error types

You can create custom error types for [errors returned by your loader](#error-handling-in-live-loaders) and pass them as a generic to get proper typing:

```ts title="my-loader.ts"
class MyLoaderError extends Error {
  constructor(
    message: string,
    public code?: string
  ) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'MyLoaderError';
  }
}

export function myLoader(config): LiveLoader<MyData, undefined, undefined, MyLoaderError> {
  return {
    name: 'my-loader',
    loadCollection: async ({ filter }) => {
      // Return your custom error type
      return {
        error: new MyLoaderError('Failed to load', 'LOAD_ERROR'),
      };
    },
    // ...
  };
}
```

When you use `getLiveCollection()` or `getLiveEntry()`, TypeScript will infer the custom error type, allowing you to handle it appropriately:

```astro
---
export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode

import { getLiveEntry } from 'astro:content';

const { entry, error } = await getLiveEntry('products', '123');

if (error) {
  if (error.name === 'MyLoaderError') {
    console.error(`Loader error: ${error.message} (code: ${error.code})`);
  } else {
    console.error(`Unexpected error: ${error.message}`);
  }
  return Astro.rewrite('/500');
}
---
```

#### Cache hints

Live loaders can provide cache hints to help with response caching. You can use this data to send HTTP cache headers or otherwise inform your caching strategy.

```ts title="my-loader.ts"
export function myLoader(config): LiveLoader<MyData> {
  return {
    name: 'cached-loader',
    loadCollection: async ({ filter }) => {
      // ... fetch data
      return {
        entries: data.map((item) => ({
          id: item.id,
          data: item,
          // You can optionally provide cache hints for each entry
          cacheHint: {
            tags: [`product-${item.id}`, `category-${item.category}`],
          },
        })),
        cacheHint: {
          // All fields are optional, and are combined with each entry's cache hints
          // tags are merged from all entries
          // maxAge is the shortest maxAge of all entries and the collection
          // lastModified is the most recent lastModified of all entries and the collection
          lastModified: new Date(item.lastModified),
          tags: ['products'],
          maxAge: 300, // 5 minutes
        },
      };
    },
    loadEntry: async ({ filter }) => {
      // ... fetch single item
      return {
        id: item.id,
        data: item,
        cacheHint: {
          lastModified: new Date(item.lastModified),
          tags: [`product-${item.id}`, `category-${item.category}`],
          maxAge: 3600, // 1 hour
        },
      };
    },
  };
}
```

You can then use these hints in your pages:

```astro
---
export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode

import { getLiveEntry } from 'astro:content';

const { entry, error, cacheHint } = await getLiveEntry('products', Astro.params.id);

if (error) {
  return Astro.redirect('/404');
}

// Apply cache hints to response headers
if (cacheHint?.tags) {
  Astro.response.headers.set('Cache-Tag', cacheHint.tags.join(','));
}
if (cacheHint?.maxAge) {
  Astro.response.headers.set('Cache-Control', `s-maxage=${cacheHint.maxAge}`);
}
if (cacheHint?.lastModified) {
  Astro.response.headers.set('Last-Modified', cacheHint.lastModified.toUTCString());
}
---

<h1>{entry.data.name}</h1>
<p>{entry.data.description}</p>
```

:::note
Cache hints only provide values that can be used in other parts of your project and do not automatically cause the response to be cached by Astro. You can use them to create your own caching strategy, such as setting HTTP headers or using a CDN.
:::

#### Distributing your loader

Loaders can be defined in your site or as a separate npm package. If you want to share your loader with the community, you can [publish it to npm with the `astro-component` and `astro-loader` keywords](/en/reference/publish-to-npm/#packagejson-data).

The loader should export a function that returns the `LiveLoader` object, allowing users to configure it with their own settings.

### Using Zod schemas with live collections

You can use Zod schemas with live collections to validate and transform data at runtime. This Zod validation works the same way as [schemas for build-time collections](#defining-the-collection-schema).

When you define a schema for a live collection, it takes precedence over [the live loader's types](#type-safety-in-live-loaders) when you query the collection:

```ts title="src/live.config.ts"
import { z, defineLiveCollection } from 'astro:content';
import { apiLoader } from './loaders/api-loader';

const products = defineLiveCollection({
  loader: apiLoader({ endpoint: process.env.API_URL }),
  schema: z
    .object({
      id: z.string(),
      name: z.string(),
      price: z.number(),
      // Transform the API's category format
      category: z.string().transform((str) => str.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '-')),
      // Coerce the date to a Date object
      createdAt: z.coerce.date(),
    })
    .transform((data) => ({
      ...data,
      // Add a formatted price field
      displayPrice: `$${data.price.toFixed(2)}`,
    })),
});

export const collections = { products };
```

When using Zod schemas, validation errors are automatically caught and returned as `AstroError` objects:

```astro
---
export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode

import { getLiveEntry, LiveCollectionValidationError } from 'astro:content';

const { entry, error } = await getLiveEntry('products', '123');

// You can handle validation errors specifically
if (LiveCollectionValidationError.is(error)) {
  console.error(error.message);
  return Astro.rewrite('/500');
}

// TypeScript knows entry.data matches your Zod schema, not the loader's type
console.log(entry?.data.displayPrice); // e.g., "$29.99"
---
```

<ReadMore>See [Zod's README](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for complete documentation on how Zod works and what features are available.</ReadMore>


### Accessing live data

Astro provides helper functions to query a live collection and return one (or more) content entries. These can be used similarly to their [build-time collection counterparts](#querying-build-time-collections).

- [`getLiveCollection()`](/en/reference/modules/astro-content/#getlivecollection) fetches an entire collection and returns an array of entries.
- [`getLiveEntry()`](/en/reference/modules/astro-content/#getliveentry) fetches a single entry from a collection.

These return entries with a unique `id`, and `data` object with all defined properties from the data loader. When using third-party or community loaders distributed as npm packages, check their own documentation for the expected shape of data returned.

You can use these functions to access your live data, passing the name of the collection and optionally filtering conditions.

```astro
---
export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode

import { getLiveCollection, getLiveEntry } from 'astro:content';

// Use loader-specific filters
const { entries: draftArticles } = await getLiveCollection('articles', {
  status: 'draft',
  author: 'john-doe',
});

// Get a specific product by ID
const { entry: product } = await getLiveEntry('products', Astro.params.slug);
---
```

#### Rendering content

If your loader [returns a `rendered` property](#providing-rendered-content), you can use [the `render()` function and `<Content />` component](#rendering-body-content) to render your content directly in your pages, using the same method as build-time collections.

You also have access to any [error returned by the live loader](#error-handling-in-live-loaders), for example, to rewrite to a 404 page when content cannot be displayed:

```astro "render(entry)" "<Content />"
---
export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode

import { getLiveEntry, render } from 'astro:content';
const { entry, error } = await getLiveEntry('articles', Astro.params.id);
if (error) {
  return Astro.rewrite('/404');
}

const { Content } = await render(entry);
---

<h1>{entry.data.title}</h1>
<Content />
```

#### Error handling

Live loaders can fail due to network issues, API errors, or validation problems. The API is designed to make error handling explicit.

When you call `getLiveCollection()` or `getLiveEntry()`, the error will be one of:

- The error type defined by the loader (if it returned an error)
- A `LiveEntryNotFoundError` if the entry was not found
- A `LiveCollectionValidationError` if the collection data does not match the expected schema
- A `LiveCollectionCacheHintError` if the cache hint is invalid
- A `LiveCollectionError` for other errors, such as uncaught errors thrown in the loader

These errors have a static `is()` method that you can use to check the type of error at runtime:

```astro "LiveEntryNotFoundError.is(error)"
---
export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode

import { getLiveEntry, LiveEntryNotFoundError } from 'astro:content';

const { entry, error } = await getLiveEntry('products', Astro.params.id);

if (error) {
  if (LiveEntryNotFoundError.is(error)) {
    console.error(`Product not found: ${error.message}`);
    Astro.response.status = 404;
  } else {
    console.error(`Error loading product: ${error.message}`);
    return Astro.redirect('/500');
  }
}
---
```

## Generating Routes from Content

Content collections are stored outside of the `src/pages/` directory. This means that no pages or routes are generated for your collection items by default by Astro's [file-based routing](/en/guides/routing/)

You will need to manually create a new [dynamic route](/en/guides/routing/#dynamic-routes) if you want to generate HTML pages for each of your collection entries, such as individual blog posts. Your dynamic route will map the incoming request param (e.g. `Astro.params.slug` in `src/pages/blog/[...slug].astro`) to fetch the correct entry for each page.

The exact method for generating routes will depend on whether your pages are prerendered (default) or rendered on demand by a server.

### Building for static output (default)

If you are building a static website (Astro's default behavior) with build-time collections, use the [`getStaticPaths()`](/en/reference/routing-reference/#getstaticpaths) function to create multiple pages from a single page component (e.g. `src/pages/[slug]`) during your build.

Call `getCollection()` inside of `getStaticPaths()` to have your collection data available for building static routes. Then, create the individual URL paths using the `id` property of each content entry. Each page is passed the entire collection entry as a prop for [use in your page template](#using-content-in-astro-templates).

```astro title="src/pages/posts/[id].astro" "{ id: post.id }" "{ post }"
---
import { getCollection, render } from 'astro:content';
// 1. Generate a new path for every collection entry
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const posts = await getCollection('blog');
  return posts.map(post => ({
    params: { id: post.id },
    props: { post },
  }));
}
// 2. For your template, you can get the entry directly from the prop
const { post } = Astro.props;
const { Content } = await render(post);
---
<h1>{post.data.title}</h1>
<Content />
```

This will generate a page route for every entry in the `blog` collection. For example, an entry at `src/blog/hello-world.md` will have an `id` of `hello-world`, and therefore its final URL will be `/posts/hello-world/`.

:::note
If your custom slugs contain the `/` character to produce URLs with multiple path segments, you must use a [rest parameter (e.g. `[...slug]`)](/en/guides/routing/#rest-parameters) in the `.astro` filename for this dynamic routing page.
:::

### Building routes on demand at request time

If you have an adapter installed and are generating your routes at request time, you will not generate any paths ahead of time during the build. Instead, your page should examine the request (using `Astro.request` or `Astro.params`) to find the `slug` on demand, and then fetch it using [`getEntry()`](/en/reference/modules/astro-content/#getentry) for build-time collection pages that are generated once, upon first request, or [`getLiveEntry()`](/en/reference/modules/astro-content/#getentry) for live collection pages where data is (re)fetched at each request time.


```astro title="src/pages/posts/[id].astro"
---
import { getEntry, render } from "astro:content";
// 1. Get the slug from the incoming server request
const { id } = Astro.params;
if (id === undefined) {
	return Astro.redirect("/404");
}
// 2. Query for the entry directly using the request slug
const post = await getEntry("blog", id);
// 3. Redirect if the entry does not exist
if (post === undefined) {
	return Astro.redirect("/404");
}
// 4. Render the entry to HTML in the template
const { Content } = await render(post);
---
<h1>{post.data.title}</h1>
<Content />
```

## Collection JSON Schemas

<p><Since v="4.13.0" /></p>

Astro auto-generates [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) files for collections, which you can use in your editor to get IntelliSense and type-checking for data files.

A JSON Schema file is generated for each collection in your project and output to the `.astro/collections/` directory.
For example, if you have two collections, one named `authors` and another named `posts`, Astro will generate `.astro/collections/authors.schema.json` and `.astro/collections/posts.schema.json`.

### Use JSON Schemas in JSON files

You can manually point to an Astro-generated schema by setting the `$schema` field in your JSON file.
The value should be a relative file path from the data file to the schema.
In the following example, a data file in `src/data/authors/` uses the schema generated for the `authors` collection:

```json title="src/data/authors/armand.json" ins={2}
{
  "$schema": "../../../.astro/collections/authors.schema.json",
  "name": "Armand",
  "skills": ["Astro", "Starlight"]
}
```

#### Use a schema for a group of JSON files in VS Code

In VS Code, you can configure a schema to apply for all files in a collection using the [`json.schemas` setting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings).
In the following example, all files in the `src/data/authors/` directory will use the schema generated for the `authors` collection:

```json
{
  "json.schemas": [
    {
      "fileMatch": ["/src/data/authors/**"],
      "url": "./.astro/collections/authors.schema.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Use schemas in YAML files in VS Code

In VS Code, you can add support for using JSON schemas in YAML files using the [Red Hat YAML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) extension.
With this extension installed, you can reference a schema in a YAML file using a special comment syntax:

```yaml title="src/data/authors/armand.yml" ins={1}
# yaml-language-server: $schema=../../../.astro/collections/authors.schema.json
name: Armand

#### Use schemas for a group of YAML files in VS Code

With the Red Hat YAML extension, you can configure a schema to apply for all YAML files in a collection using the `yaml.schemas` setting.
In the following example, all YAML files in the `src/data/authors/` directory will use the schema generated for the `authors` collection:

```json
{
  "yaml.schemas": {
    "./.astro/collections/authors.schema.json": ["/src/content/authors/*.yml"]
  }
}
```

See [“Associating schemas”](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml#associating-schemas) in the Red Hat YAML extension documentation for more details.

## Live collection limitations

Live content collections have some limitations compared to build-time collections:

- **No MDX support**: MDX cannot be rendered at runtime
- **No image optimization**: Images cannot be processed at runtime
- **Performance considerations**: Data is fetched on each request (unless cached)
- **No data store persistence**: Data is not saved to the content layer data store

## Differences from build-time collections

Live collections use a different API than build-time content collections. Key differences include:

1. **Execution time**: Run at request time instead of build time
2. **Configuration file**: Use `src/live.config.ts` instead of `src/content.config.ts`
3. **Collection definition**: Use `defineLiveCollection()` instead of `defineCollection()`
4. **Loader API**: Implement `loadCollection` and `loadEntry` methods instead of the `load` method
5. **Data return**: Return data directly instead of storing in the data store
6. **User-facing functions**: Use `getLiveCollection`/`getLiveEntry` instead of `getCollection`/`getEntry`
