description: Learn how to enable experimental asset support in Astro.
i18nReady: false

**Built-in Asset Support** is enabled in Astro behind an experimental flag. This built-in feature will eventually replace the optional `@astrojs/image` integration. 

The new assets experience currently features:

- A new built-in `<Image />` component
- Relative images with automatic optimization in Markdown and MDX files
- Integration with [Content Collections](/en/guides/content-collections/)
- Improved error messages and types

:::caution
Assets are an _experimental_ Astro feature. This API is subject to change before it is marked as stable.
:::

## Enabling Assets in your Project

Enabling assets may cause some breaking changes in your project. It may also require some manual changes to take advantage of new features.

Please check every section below to avoid errors and to get the most out of using the experimental assets option!

### Update Config

To enable built-in asset support, add the following lines to your `astro.config.mjs` configuration file.

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={4-6} 
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
 experimental: {
  assets: true
 }
});
```

### Move your images to `src/assets/`

Create a new folder `src/assets/` which Astro will recogize as your new assets folder.

We **strongly recommend** storing all local images the `src/assets/` directory. This location is optional for now, but may become the required location for all asset types in the future.

Your images stored in `src/assets/` can be used by components (`.astro`, `.mdx` and other UI frameworks) and [in Markdown files](#update-your-markdown-files).

{/* Import them from a **relative file path** or [import alias](/en/guides/aliases/) in any component file and then use the import as the `Image` component's `src` attribute. */}

{/* astro
---
// src/pages/index.astro
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';

// Access images in `src/images/`
import logo from '../assets/images/logo.png';
---
<Image src={logo} alt="Astro" /> */}


### Update existing `<img>` tags

Previously, importing an image would return a simple `string` with the path of the image. With the new `image` features enabled, imported image assets now match the following signature:

```ts
interface ImageAsset {
  src: string;
  width: number;
  height: number;
  format: string;
}
```

You must update the `src` attribute of any existing `<img>` tags, and you may also update other attributes that are now available to you from the imported image.

```astro title="src/components/MyComponent.astro" ".src" ".width" ".height" del={2,5} ins={3,6}
---
import rocket from '../images/rocket.svg';
import rocket from '../assets/images/rocket.svg'
---
<img src={rocket} width="250" height="250" alt="A rocketship in space." />
<img src={rocket.src} width={rocket.width} height={rocket.height} alt="A rocketship in space." />
```

### Update your Markdown files

Relative images located in `src/assets` can now be referenced in Markdown and MDX files. These will automatically be optimized and hashed by Astro's build process.

This allows you to move your images from the `public/` directory to the new, reserved `src/assets/` directory. (See the URL path of these built images in the example below.)

Your existing images in `public/` and remote images are still valid, but are not automatically optimized by Astro's build process.

```md title="src/pages/posts/post-1.md" "/_astro" ".hash" "../../assets/"
# My Markdown Page

<!-- Local image stored at src/assets/stars.png -->
![A starry night sky.](../../assets/stars.png)
<img src="/_astro/stars.hash.png" alt="A starry night sky.">

<!-- Image stored at public/images/stars.png -->
![A starry night sky.](/images/stars.png)
<img src="/images/stars.png" alt="A starry night sky.">

<!-- Remote image on another server -->
![Astro logo](https://astro.build/assets/logo.png)
<img src="https://astro.build/assets/logo.png" width="25" alt="Astro logo">
```

### Convert from `@astrojs/image`

**Built-in asset support is incompatible with the `@astrojs/image` integration.**

To avoid errors in your project, complete the following steps:

1. Remove the `@astrojs/image` integration.

    You must [remove the integration](/en/guides/integrations-guide/#removing-an-integration) by uninstalling and then removing from your `astro.config.mjs` file.

2. Migrate any existing `<Image />` components.

    Change all `import` statements from `@astrojs/image/components` to `astro:assets` to use the new built-in `<Image />` component.

    The supported props are identical with the exception of `aspectRatio`, which is now automatically inferred from the `width` and `height` attributes.

      ```astro title="src/components/MyComponent.astro" del= {2,11} ins={3}
      ---
      import { Image } from '@astrojs/image/components';
      import { Image } from 'astro:assets'
      import localImage from "../assets/logo.png";
      const localAlt = "The Astro Logo";
      ---

      <Image 
        src={localImage}
        width={300}
        aspectRatio="16:9"
        alt={localAlt} 
      />
      ```


3. Remove any existing `<Picture />` components

    Currently, the built-in assets feature does not include a `<Picture />` component. 
    
    Instead, use the new `<Image />` component or the HTML `<picture>` tag.

    ```astro del={2,8} ins={3,9}
    ---
    import { Picture } from '@astrojs/image/components';
    import { Image } from 'astro:assets'
    import localImage from '../assets/logo.png';
    const localAlt = "The Astro Logo";
    ---

    <Picture src={localImage} widths={[200, 400, 800]} sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" formats={['avif', 'jpeg', 'png', 'webp']} alt="The Astro logo" />
    <Image src={localImage} alt="The Astro logo" />
    ```

### Update content collections schemas

A new `asset` helper for content collections can validate the metadata of images located in the `src/assets/` folder, such as author photos or blog cover images.

```ts
import { asset, defineCollection, z } from "astro:content";

const blogCollection = defineCollection({
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    image: asset({ width: 1120, height: 1120 }),
  }),
});
```

The image metadata will be transformed to match the signature of imported images, and therefore can be passed directly to the `<Image />` component or the `getImage()` function.


## `astro:assets` module

Enabling asset support allows you to access the `astro:assets` module. This module exposes the following features:

- `Image`
- `getImage()`

### `<Image />`

The `<Image />` component generates an `<img>` tag with all the necessary attributes needed to display the image while avoiding Content Layout Shift **(CLS)**.

:::tip[What is Content Layout Shift?]
CLS is a score that reflects how much content shifted on your page during loading. The ideal number for CLS is as close to zero as possible, which the `Image` component enforces by automatically selecting the correct `width` and `height` for local images.
:::

```astro
---
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import myImage from "../assets/my_image.png"; // Image is 1600x900
---

<!-- `alt` is mandatory on the Image component -->
<Image src={myImage} alt="..." />
```

```astro
<!-- Output -->
<!-- Image is optimized, proper attributes are enforced -->
<img
  src="/_astro/my_image.hash.webp"
  width="1600"
  height="900"
  decoding="async"
  loading="lazy"
  alt="..."
/>
```

#### Properties

##### width and height

These properties are used to size the image while ensuring there will be no CLS. These properties are required for remote images. When using local images, the `width` and `height` can be automatically inferred from the source file.

##### format

`format` is used to set the [image file type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#common_image_file_types). This property is optional, but the default is `webp`.

##### quality

`quality` affects the image transformation quality. It can either be a preset from `low`, `medium`, `high`, `max` (automatically normalized between formats) or a number from `0` to `100` (interpreted differently between formats.) This property is optional.

##### alt

Not all users can see images in the same way, so accessibility is an especially important concern when using images. Use the `alt` attribute to provide [descriptive alt text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/) for images.

This attribute is required for the `<Image />` component. This component will throw an error if no alt text is provided.

If the image is merely decorative (i.e. doesn't contribute to the understanding of the page), set `alt=""` so that screen readers know to ignore the image.

##### Additional properties

In addition to the properties listed previously, the Image component accepts all the properties accepted by the HTML `img` tag. You can use this, for example, to provide a `class` to the final `img` element.

```astro
---
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import myImage from "../assets/my_image.png";
---

<!-- `alt` is mandatory on the Image component -->
<Image src={myImage} alt="..." class="my-class" />
```

```astro
<!-- Output -->
<img
  src="/_astro/my_image.hash.webp"
  width="1600"
  height="900"
  decoding="async"
  loading="lazy"
  class="my-class"
/>
```

### `getImage()`

In addition to the component, a `getImage()` function is provided. This function is intended for generating images destined to be used somewhere else than directly in HTML, such as for usage in CSS or in an [API Route](/en/core-concepts/endpoints/#server-endpoints-api-routes).

This function takes the same parameters as the Image component, apart from `alt`.

```astro
---
import { getImage } from "astro:assets";
import myBackground from "../background.png"

const optimizedBackground = await getImage({src: myBackground, format: 'avif'})
---

<div style={`background-image: url(${optimizedBackground.src});`}></div>
```

It returns an objet with the following properties:

```js
{
  options: {...} // Original parameters passed,
  src: "https//..." // Path to the generate image,
  attributes: {...} // Additional HTML attributes needed to render the image (width, height, style, etc..)
}
```
