You can use [EdgeOne Pages](https://pages.edgeone.ai/) to deploy an Astro site to their global edge network with zero configuration.

This guide includes instructions for deploying to EdgeOne Pages through the website UI or EdgeOne Pages's CLI.

## Project configuration

Your Astro project can be deployed to EdgeOne Pages as a static site, or a server-rendered site.

<Steps>
1. **Installing the Astro Adapter for Pages**

  - The Astro adapter for pages, named `@edgeone/Astro`, is an adapter that automatically adapts the build results of an Astro application to the pages platform, similar to `@astrojs/vercel`. It can work in conjunction with the pages scaffolding tool to package and deploy a local Astro project to the pages platform. Below is the command to install the adapter:
  ```bash
   npm install @edgeone/astro
   ```
  
2. **Configuring Astro.Config.Mjs**
  - According to the API of Astro's configuration file, users need to configure the Pages platform adapter in the project's astro.config.mjs. Example configuration:

```ts title="astro.config.mjs"
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import edgeoneAdapter from "@edgeone/astro";

export default defineConfig({
  adapter: edgeoneAdapter(),
});
```

3. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**
- You can use Astro to generate completely static sites. Configured as static export mode, modify astro.config.mjs as in the following example:
```ts {2} title="astro.config.mjs"
export default defineConfig({
  output: 'static'  // Enable static export
});
```
4. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
- The Pages adapter also supports Astro's server-side rendering feature. Set the following configuration in astro.config.mjs to enable SSR mode:
```ts {2} title="astro.config.mjs"
export default defineConfig({
  output: 'server'  // Enable static export
});
```
5. **Deploying a Project**

- **Connecting Git for Deployment**
After seamless integration with the adapter, you can submit the project to platforms like GitHub or GitLab, and use their [Git Connection Deployment](https://pages.edgeone.ai/document/importing-a-git-repository).

- **CLI Deployment**
You can also install the Pages scaffolding tool. For detailed installation and usage, refer to [EdgeOne CLI](https://pages.edgeone.ai/document/edgeone-cli). Once configured, use the `edgeone pages deploy` command to deploy the project. During deployment, the CLI will first auto-build the project, then upload and publish the build artifacts.﻿
