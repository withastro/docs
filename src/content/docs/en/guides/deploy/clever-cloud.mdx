[Clever Cloud](https://clever-cloud.com) is a European cloud platform that provides automated, scalable services.

## Project Configuration

You can deploy both fully static and on-demand rendered Astro projects on Clever Cloud. Regardless of your `output` mode (pre-rendered or [on-demand](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/)), you can choose to deploy as a **static application** which runs using a post-build hook, or as a **Node.js** application, which requires some manual configuration in your `package.json`.

### Scripts

If you're running an on-demand Node.js application, update your `start` script to run the Node server. Applications on Clever Cloud listen on port **8080**.

```json title="package.json"
"scripts": {
  "start": "node ./dist/server/entry.mjs --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080",
} 
```

## Deploy Astro from the Console

To deploy your Astro project to Clever Cloud, you will need to **create a new application**. The application wizard will walk you through the necessary configuration steps.

<Steps>

1. From the lateral menubar, click **Create** > **An application**
2. Choose how to deploy:

    - **Create a brand new app**: to deploy from a local repository with Git
    
    or
    
    - **Select a GitHub repository**: to deploy from GitHub

3. Select a **Node.js** application, or a **static** one.
4. Set up the minimal size for your instance and scalability options. Astro sites can typically be deployed using the **Nano** instance. Depending on your project's specifications and dependencies, you may need to adjust accordingly as you watch the metrics from the **Overview** page.
5. Select a **region** to deploy your instance.
6. Skip [connecting **Add-ons** to your Clever application](https://developers.clever-cloud.com/doc/addons/) unless you're using a database or Keycloak.
7. Inject **environment variables**:

    - For **Node.js**, no specific environment variable is needed to deploy Astro if you're using **npm**. If you're using **yarn** or **pnpm**, set the following environment variables:

    <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="pnpm">
      ```shell
      CC_NODE_BUILD_TOOL="custom"
      CC_PRE_BUILD_HOOK="npm install -g pnpm && pnpm install"
      CC_CUSTOM_BUILD_TOOL="pnpm run astro telemetry disable && pnpm build"
      ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="yarn">
      ```shell
      CC_NODE_BUILD_TOOL="yarn"
      CC_PRE_BUILD_HOOK="yarn && yarn run astro telemetry disable && yarn build"
      ```
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    - For a **static** application, add these variables:

    <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="npm">
      ```shell
      CC_POST_BUILD_HOOK="npm run build"
      CC_PRE_BUILD_HOOK="npm install && npm run astro telemetry disable"
      CC_WEBROOT="/dist"
      ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="pnpm">
      ```shell
      CC_POST_BUILD_HOOK="pnpm build"
      CC_PRE_BUILD_HOOK="npm install -g pnpm && pnpm install && pnpm run astro telemetry disable"
      CC_WEBROOT="/dist"
      ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="yarn">
      ```shell
      CC_POST_BUILD_HOOK="yarn build"
      CC_PRE_BUILD_HOOK="yarn && yarn run astro telemetry disable"
      CC_WEBROOT="/dist"
      ```
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>


8. **Deploy!** If you're deploying from **GitHub**, your deployment should start automatically. If you're using **Git**, copy the remote and push on the **master** branch. 

</Steps>

:::tip[Other Branches]
To deploy from branches other than `master`, use `git push clever <branch>:master`.

For example, if you want to deploy your local `main` branch without renaming it, use `git push clever main:master`.
