You can use [Vercel](http://vercel.com/) to deploy an Astro site to their global edge network with zero configuration.

This guide includes instructions for deploying to Vercel through the website UI or Vercel's CLI.

## Project Configuration

Your Astro project can be deployed to Vercel as a static site, or as an on-demand rendered site.

### Static Site

Your Astro project is a static site by default. You don’t need any extra configuration to deploy a static Astro site to Vercel. 

### on-demand Rendered Site

To enable on-demand rendering in your Astro project and deploy on Vercel:

Add [the Vercel adapter](/en/guides/integrations-guide/vercel/) to your Astro project with the following `astro add` command. This will install the adapter and make the appropriate changes to your `astro.config.mjs` file in one step.

```bash
npx astro add vercel
```

If you prefer to install the adapter manually instead, complete the following two steps:

1. Install [the `@astrojs/vercel` adapter](/en/guides/integrations-guide/vercel/) to your project’s dependencies using your preferred package manager. If you’re using npm or aren’t sure, run this in the terminal:

    ```bash
      npm install @astrojs/vercel
    ```

1. Add two new lines to your `astro.config.mjs` project configuration file.

    ```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={2, 5-6}
    import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
    import vercel from '@astrojs/vercel/serverless';

    export default defineConfig({
      output: 'server',
      adapter: vercel(),
    });
    ```

## How to deploy

You can deploy to Vercel through the website UI or using Vercel’s CLI (command line interface). The process is the same for both static and on-demand rendered Astro sites.

### Website UI Deployment

1. Push your code to your online Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket).
2. [Import your project](https://vercel.com/new) into Vercel.
3. Vercel will automatically detect Astro and configure the right settings.
4. Your application is deployed! (e.g. [astro.vercel.app](https://astro.vercel.app/))

After your project has been imported and deployed, all subsequent pushes to branches will generate [Preview Deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/preview-deployments), and all changes made to the Production Branch (commonly “main”) will result in a [Production Deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/environments#production).

### CLI Deployment

1. Install the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) and run `vercel` to deploy.

    ```bash
    npm install -g vercel
    vercel
    ```

2. Vercel will automatically detect Astro and configure the right settings.
3. When asked `Want to override the settings? [y/N]`, choose `N`.
4. Your application is deployed! (e.g. [astro.vercel.app](https://astro.vercel.app/))


### Project config with vercel.json

You can use `vercel.json` to override the default behavior of Vercel and to configure additional settings. For example, you may wish to attach headers to HTTP responses from your Deployments. 

📚 Learn more about [Vercel’s project configuration](https://vercel.com/docs/project-configuration).

### Upgrading to Astro 2.0

Astro v2.0 drops support for Node 14, so make sure your project is using **Node `18.14.1` or later**. You can [define the Node.js version](https://vercel.com/changelog/node-js-version-now-customizable-in-the-project-settings) used during the Build Step and Serverless Functions from the General page under Project Settings.
