You can deploy your Astro site to [Orbiter](https://orbiter.host) in seconds with a simple upload. 

## Setup

In order to follow this tutorial you’ll want the following:

- An account on Orbiter: [sign up for a free account](https://app.orbiter.host) in less than a minute.
- Node.js (version 20 or higher
- A text editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Zed](https://zed.dev)

That’s it! Once you’ve got all your tools together let’s open the terminal and run this command:

```
npm create astro@latest orbiter-site
```

This will run a lovely install walkthrough about what your preferences. For simplicity answer with the following:

```
  tmpl   How would you like to start your new project?
	         ● A basic, minimal starter (recommended)
	deps   Install dependencies? (recommended)
           ● Yes
  git   Initialize a new git repository? (optional)
           ● Yes
```

Once it’s finished installing you can open the folder `orbiter-site` with your text editor and move to the next step.

## Build

When you open up the project directory you should see the following structure:

```
.
├── README.md
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── public
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src
│   ├── assets
│   │   ├── astro.svg
│   │   └── background.svg
│   ├── components
│   │   └── Welcome.astro
│   ├── layouts
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages
│       └── index.astro
└── tsconfig.json

7 directories, 11 files
```

The template is designed to give you a feel for all the pieces that go into an Astro website. Let’s briefly go over each of them:

### Assets

This is where you can keep images that you want to use in your site. The public directory works too, this is just a bit friendlier and will bundle it all together and keep it neat.

### Pages

Pages are how you designate different routes. For instance, you could create a new folder inside of `pages` called `about`, then put an `index.astro` file in there. This would create the path `/about` on your website. Let’s look inside the `pages/index.astro`

```tsx
---
import Welcome from '../components/Welcome.astro';
import Layout from '../layouts/Layout.astro';

// Welcome to Astro! Wondering what to do next? Check out the Astro documentation at https://docs.astro.build
// Don't want to use any of this? Delete everything in this file, the `assets`, `components`, and `layouts` directories, and start fresh.
---

<Layout>
	<Welcome />
</Layout>
```

All we have here are two simple pieces, a `Layout` and a `Welcome` component. That’s a perfect intro into the next part of Astro.

### Layouts

These are similar to pages or components, but they’re specially designed to work as the framing inside your pages to go around your components. Let’s peek inside the default `layouts/Layout.astro` file:

```tsx
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
		<link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
		<meta name="generator" content={Astro.generator} />
		<title>Astro Basics</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<slot />
	</body>
</html>

<style>
	html,
	body {
		margin: 0;
		width: 100%;
		height: 100%;
	}
</style>
```

As you can see it’s used to help define some of the default HTML and basic styles that you normally would have to include with every HTML page. Between the `<body>` tags is the `<slot />` tag where content can go. With this model you can apply default styles, dynamic metadata, and more, all without having to write the same HTML scaffolding over and over.

### Components

Inside that `<slot>` tag from the Layout is where we can put our components. This is generally the meat and potatoes of your website, so let’s examine the `Welcome.astro` component:

```tsx
---
import astroLogo from '../assets/astro.svg';
import background from '../assets/background.svg';
---

<div id="container">
	<img id="background" src={background.src} alt="" fetchpriority="high" />
	<main>
		<section id="hero">
			<a href="https://astro.build"
				><img src={astroLogo.src} width="115" height="48" alt="Astro Homepage" /></a

Here we have normal HTML markup with tags, styles, and scripts if we wanted to include them. What makes these special and different from normal HTML is the front matter at the top of the page. This is where you can dynamically import other components or assets to be used in your site.

## Deploy

So we have our site, let’s see what deployment looks like. It’s really simple actually; first thing you want to do is open the `astro.config.mjs` file and add in the following code:

```tsx
// @ts-check
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

// https://astro.build/config
export default defineConfig({
  output: 'static'
});
```

This is the only config change we need to make our Astro site deploy as a static site. Now you can run the following command to build the site:

```tsx
npm run build
```

You should see it build and deploy a `dist` folder. This is what we’ll upload to Orbiter now! Visit [app.orbiter.host](http://app.orbiter.host) and login. Once you’re logged in just click “Create Site” in the top right and drag and drop the `dist` folder, and give it a name.

![dashboard](https://cdn.orbiter.host/ipfs/bafkreihjoby7gf4i5xm6z3ee2ei3h4hvu6kl2fvw6qnkdluohrf6mhlr7i)

Once completed you should see the site on the dashboard; just click to visit!

![site](https://cdn.orbiter.host/ipfs/bafkreiflv5paywdcfgxzflg223e6qkaw4ijbzucx6i4ldi66jricgtqsou)

Orbiter also has a CLI, which will let you upload sites even faster! Run the command below to install it:

```bash
npm i -g orbiter-cli
```

Once it’s installed just run `orbiter login --provider google` or `github` depending on your preference. After logging in, creating a site is just one command:

```bash
orbiter create --domain astro-demo ./dist
```

Within seconds you should see a link to your new site. Updating is just as easy. You can use the web app, click the update site button, and provide the new `dist` folder. Or, you can use the CLI. If you'd like a more automated flow, you can integrate the CLI into the `package.json`. First run `orbiter list` to see your sites and grab the `id` of your site. Then in your `package.json` add the `deploy` to the scripts:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "astro dev",
    "build": "astro build",
    "preview": "astro preview",
    "astro": "astro",
    "deploy": "astro build && orbiter update --siteId <your-site-id> ./dist"
  },
```

Make sure to replace `<your-site-id>` with your own site `id`, then when you run `npm run deploy` it will update your orbiter site just like that!
