You can use [Kinsta Application Hosting](https://kinsta.com/application-hosting/) to host an Astro site on their cloud hosting.

## Configuring your Astro project

### Static hosting
:::tip[Looking for an example?]
Check out [the official Kinsta Application Hosting Starter project for Astro](https://github.com/kinsta/hello-world-astro)!
:::

To host your project on **Kinsta Application Hosting**, you need to:
- Include a `name` field in your `package.json`. (This can be anything, and will not affect your deployment.)
- Include a `build` script in your `package.json`. (Your Astro project should already include this.)
- Install the [`serve`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) package and set the `start` script to `serve dist/`.

Here are the necessary lines in your `package.json` file:
```json title="package.json" {2,5,6} ins={12} "serv dist/"
{
  "name": "anything", // This is required, but the value does not matter.
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "astro dev",
    "start": "serve dist/",
    "build": "astro build",
    "preview": "astro preview",
    "astro": "astro"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "astro": "^2.2.0",
    "serve": "^14.0.1"
  },
}
```

### SSR

To host your project on **Kinsta Application Hosting**, you need to:
- Include a `name` field in your `package.json`. (This can be anything, and will not affect your deployment.)
- Include a `build` script in your `package.json`. (Your Astro project should already include this.)
- Install the [`@astrojs/node`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@astrojs/node) package and set the `start` script to `node ./dist/server/entry.mjs`.
- Set the `astro.config.mjs` to use `@astrojs/node` and to use `host: true`.

Here are the necessary lines in your `package.json` file:
```json title="package.json" {2,5,6} ins={12} "node ./dist/server/entry.mjs"
{
  "name": "anything", // This is required, but the value does not matter.
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "astro dev",
    "start": "node ./dist/server/entry.mjs",
    "build": "astro build",
    "preview": "astro preview",
    "astro": "astro"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "astro": "^2.2.0",
    "@astrojs/node": "^5.1.1"
  },
}
```

Here are the necessary lines in your `astro.config.mjs` file:
```js title="astro.config.mjs"
  import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
  import node from "@astrojs/node";

  export default defineConfig({
    output: 'server',
    adapter: node({
      mode: "standalone"
    }),
    server: {
      host: true
    }
  });
```
