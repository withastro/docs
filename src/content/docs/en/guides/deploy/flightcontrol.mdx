You can deploy an Astro site using [Flightcontrol](https://www.flightcontrol.dev?ref=astro), which provides fully-automated deployments to your AWS account.

Supports both static and SSR Astro sites.

## How to Deploy

<Steps>
1. Create a Flightcontrol account at [app.flightcontrol.dev/signup](https://app.flightcontrol.dev/signup?ref=astro)

2. Go to [app.flightcontrol.dev/projects/new/1](https://app.flightcontrol.dev/projects/new/1)

3. Connect your GitHub account and select your repo

4. Select your desired "Config Type":
    - `GUI` (all config managed through Flightcontrol dashboard) where you will select the `Astro Static` or `Astro SSR` preset
    - `flightcontrol.json` ("infrastructure as code" option where all config is in your repo) where you will select an Astro example config, then add it to your codebase as `flightcontrol.json`

5. Adjust any configuration as needed

6. Click "Create Project" and complete any required steps (like linking your AWS account).
</Steps>

### SSR Setup

To deploy with SSR support, make sure you first set up the [`@astrojs/node`](/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/) adapter. Then, follow the steps above, choosing the appropriate configurations for Astro SSR.
