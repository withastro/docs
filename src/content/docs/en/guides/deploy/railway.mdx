[Railway](https://railway.com) is a deployment platform built to simplify your infrastructure stack from servers to observability with a single, scalable platform.

This guide is for deploying an Astro static site to Railway using either the web interface or Railway CLI tool.

## Project Configuration

Add a `railway.json` file at the root of your Astro project, with the following configuration:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.com/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "RAILPACK"
  }
}
```

This sets the default build system to Railpack, Railway's newer build system which will automatically build your Astro project as a static site.

## Deploy via the web interface

  1. Create a [Railway account](https://railway.com/dashboard) and sign in

  2. From the Railway dashboard, create a new [project](https://docs.railway.com/guides/projects)
  
  3. Select the option to deploy from a GitHub repository, and select your Astro project
  
  4. Generate or add a custom domain from your project's [network settings](https://docs.railway.com/guides/public-networking#railway-provided-domain) 
</Steps>
