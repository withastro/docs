[Railway](https://railway.com) is a deployment platform built to simplify your infrastructure stack from servers to observability with a single, scalable platform.

This guide is for deploying an Astro static site to Railway using either the web interface or Railway CLI tool.

:::tip
To deploy an Astro site with on-demand rendering (SSR) using the Node adapter, you can follow [Railway's guide to deploying an Astro site](https://docs.railway.com/guides/astro).

  2. From the Railway dashboard, create a new [project](https://docs.railway.com/guides/projects).
  
  3. Select the option to deploy from a GitHub repository, and select your Astro project.
  
  4. Generate or add a custom domain from your project's [network settings](https://docs.railway.com/guides/public-networking#railway-provided-domain).
</Steps>

## Deploy via Railway CLI

<Steps>
  1. [Install](https://docs.railway.com/guides/cli#installing-the-cli) the Railway CLI tool.

  2. Login with the command `railway login`.
  
  3. From within your Astro project, run `railway init` and choose a workspace and project name.
  
  4. Run `railway up` to deploy your project on Railway.
