You can deploy your Astro project on [Azion](https://console.azion.com/), a platform for frontend developers to collaborate and deploy static (JAMstack) and SSR websites.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you will need:

- An [Azion account](https://www.azion.com/). If you don’t have one, you can sign up for a free account.  
- Your app code stored in a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository.  
- [Azion CLI](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/) installed for faster project setup and deployment.

## How to Deploy through Azion Console Dashboard

To start building, follow these steps:

<Steps>
1. Access [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).  
2. On the homepage, click the **\+ Create** button.  
   - This opens a modal with the options to create new applications and resources.  
3. Select the **Import from GitHub** option and click the card.  
   - This action opens the settings page.  
4. Connect your Azion account with GitHub.  
   - A pop-up window will appear asking for authorization.  
5. Select the repository you want to import from GitHub.  
6. Configure the build settings:  
   - **Framework preset:** Select the appropriate framework (e.g., `Astro`).  
   - **Root Directory:** This refers to the directory in which your code is located. Your code must be located at the root directory, not a subdirectory. A ./ symbol appears in this field, indicating it’s a root directory.  
   - **Install Command:** the command that compiles your settings to build for production. Build commands are executed through scripts. For example: npm run build or npm install for an NPM package.  
7. Click **Save and Deploy**.  
8. Monitor the deployment using **Azion Real-Time Metrics** and verify your site is live on the edge.
</Steps>

## How to Deploy a Static Site Using the Azion CLI

<Steps>

1. **Install the Azion CLI:**  
     
   - Download and install the [Azion CLI](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/) for easier management and deployment.

   :::caution
   The Azion CLI does not currently support native Windows environments. However, you can use it on Windows through the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Follow the [WSL installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to set up a Linux environment on your Windows machine.
   :::

2. **Authenticate the CLI:**  
     
   - Run the following command to authenticate your CLI with your Azion account.

   ```bash
   azion login
   ```

3. **Set Up Your Application:**  
     
   - Use the following commands to initialize and configure your project:

   ```bash
   azion init
   ```  

4. **Build Your Astro Project:**  
     
   - Run your build command locally:

   ```bash
   azion build
   ```

5. **Deploy Your Static Files:**  
     
   - Deploy your static files using the Azion CLI:

   ```bash
   azion deploy
   ```
</Steps>

This guide provides an overview of deploying static applications.

## Enabling Local Development Using Azion CLI

For the preview to work, you must execute the following command:

```bash
azion dev
```

Once you've initialized the local development server, the application goes through the `build` process.

```bash 
Building your Edge Application. This process may take a few minutes
Running build step command:
...
```

Then, when the build is complete, the access to the application is prompted: 

```bash
[Azion Bundler] [Server] › ✔  success   Function running on port http://localhost:3000 
```

## Troubleshooting


### Node.js runtime APIs

A project using an NPM package fails to build with an error message such as `[Error] Could not resolve "XXXX. The package "XXXX" wasn't found on the file system but is built into node.`:

This means that a package or import you are using is not compatible with Azion’s runtime APIs.

If you are directly importing a Node.js runtime API, please refer to the [Azion Node.js compatibility](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/azion-edge-runtime/compatibility/node/) for further steps on how to resolve this.

If you are importing a package that imports a Node.js runtime API, check with the author of the package to see if they support the `node:*` import syntax. If they do not, you may need to find an alternative package.
