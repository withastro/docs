You can deploy your Astro project on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), a platform for frontend developers to collaborate and deploy static (JAMstack) and SSR websites.

This guide includes:

- [How to deploy through the Cloudflare Pages Dashboard](#how-to-deploy-a-site-with-git)
- [How to deploy using Wrangler, the Cloudflare CLI](#how-to-deploy-a-site-using-wrangler)
- [How to deploy an SSR site using `@astrojs/cloudflare`](#how-to-deploy-an-ssr-site)

## Prerequisites

To get started, you will need:

- A Cloudflare account. If you don’t already have one, you can create a free Cloudflare account during the process.
- Your app code pushed to a [GitHub](https://github.com/) or a [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) repository.

## How to deploy a site with Git

1. Set up a new project on Cloudflare Pages.
2. Push your code to your git repository (GitHub, GitLab).
3. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard and select your account in **Account Home** > **Pages**.
4. Select **Create a new Project** and the **Connect Git** option.
5. Select the git project you want to deploy and click **Begin setup**
6. Use the following build settings:

    - **Framework preset**: `Astro`
    - **Build command:** `npm run build`
    - **Build output directory:** `dist`

7. Click the **Save and Deploy** button.

## How to deploy a site using Wrangler

1. Install [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/get-started/).
2. Authenticate Wrangler with your Cloudflare account using `wrangler login`.
3. Run your build command.
4. Deploy using `npx wrangler pages publish dist`.

```bash
# Install Wrangler CLI
npm install -g wrangler
# Login to Cloudflare account from CLI
wrangler login
# Run your build command
npm run build
# Create new deployment
npx wrangler pages publish dist
```

After your assets are uploaded, Wrangler will give you a preview URL to inspect your site. When you log into the Cloudflare Pages dashboard, you will see your new project.

### Enabling Preview locally with Wrangler

For the preview to work, you must install `wrangler`

```bash
pnpm install wrangler --save-dev
```

It's then possible to update the preview script to run `wrangler` instead of Astro’s built-in preview command:


```json title="package.json"
"preview": "wrangler pages dev ./dist"
```

## How to deploy an SSR site

You can build an Astro SSR site for deployment to Cloudflare Pages using the [`@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter](/en/guides/integrations-guide/cloudflare/).

Follow the steps below to set up the adapter. You can then deploy using either of the approaches documented above.

### Quick install

Add the Cloudflare adapter to enable SSR in your Astro project with the following `astro add` command. This will install the adapter and make the appropriate changes to your `astro.config.mjs` file in one step.

```bash
npx astro add cloudflare
```

### Manual install

If you prefer to install the adapter manually instead, complete the following two steps:

1. Add the `@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter to your project's dependencies using your preferred package manager. If you’re using npm or aren’t sure, run this in the terminal:

    ```bash
    npm install @astrojs/cloudflare
    ```

2. Add the following to your `astro.config.mjs` file:

    ```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={2, 5-6}
    import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
    import cloudflare from '@astrojs/cloudflare';

    export default defineConfig({
      output: 'server',
      adapter: cloudflare()
    });
    ```

### Modes

There are currently two modes supported when using Pages Functions with the [`@astrojs/cloudflare`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/packages/integrations/cloudflare#readme) adapter.

1. **Advanced** mode: This mode is used when you want to run your function in `advanced` mode which picks up the `_worker.js` in `dist`, or a directory mode where pages will compile the worker out of a functions folder in the project root.

    If no mode is set, the default  is `"advanced"`.

2. **directory** mode: This mode is used when you want to run your function in `directory` mode, which means the adapter will compile the client side part of your app the same way, but it will move the worker script into a `functions` folder in the project root. The adaptor will only ever place a `[[path]].js` in that folder, allowing you to add additional plugins and pages middleware which can be checked into version control.

    ```ts title="astro.config.mjs" "directory"
    export default defineConfig({
      adapter: cloudflare({ mode: "directory" }),
    });
    ```
### Using Pages Functions

[Pages Functions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/) enable you to run server-side code to enable dynamic functionality without running a dedicated server.

To get started, create a `/functions` directory at the root of your project. Writing your Functions files in this directory automatically generates a Worker with custom functionality at the predesignated routes. To learn more about writing Functions, see the [Pages Functions documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/).

## Troubleshooting

If you're encountering errors, double-check the version of `node` you're using locally (`node -v`) matches the version you're specifying in the environment variable.

Cloudflare requires [Node v16.13](https://miniflare.dev/get-started/cli#installation), which is a more recent version than Astro’s out-of-the-box minimum, so double check you’re using at least v16.13.

Client-side hydration may fail as a result of Cloudflare's Auto Minify setting. If you see `Hydration completed but contains mismatches` in the console, make sure to disable Auto Minify under Cloudflare settings.
