You can deploy full-stack applications, including front-end static assets and back-end APIs, as well as SSR sites, to both [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/) and [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). 

This guide includes:

- [How to deploy to Cloudflare Workers](#cloudflare-workers)
- [How to deploy to Cloudflare Pages](#cloudflare-pages)

<ReadMore>Read more about [using the Cloudflare runtime](/en/guides/integrations-guide/cloudflare/) in your Astro project.</ReadMore>
## Prerequisites

To get started, you will need a Cloudflare account. If you don’t already have one, you can create a free Cloudflare account during the process.

## Cloudflare Workers

### How to deploy with Wrangler

<Steps>
1. Install [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/get-started/).

    ```bash
    npm install wrangler@latest --save-dev
    ```

2. If your site uses on demand rendering, install the `@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter.

    This will install the adapter and make the appropriate changes to your `astro.config.mjs` file in one step.
    
      ```bash
      npx astro add cloudflare
      ```
      
    <ReadMore>Read more about [on demand rendering (also known as SSR) in Astro](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/).</ReadMore>

3. Create a [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/).

    <StaticSsrTabs>
      <Fragment slot="static">
        ```jsonc
        // wrangler.jsonc
        {
          "$schema": "node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
          "name": "my-astro-app",
          // Update to today's date
          "compatibility_date": "2025-03-25",
          "assets": {
            "directory": "./dist"
          }
        }
        ```
      </Fragment>
      <Fragment slot="ssr">
        ```jsonc
        // wrangler.jsonc
        {
          "$schema": "node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
          "name": "my-astro-app",
          "main": "./dist/_worker.js/index.js",
          // Update to today's date
          "compatibility_date": "2025-03-25",
          "compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"],
          "assets": {
            "binding": "ASSETS",
            "directory": "./dist"
          },
          "observability": {
            "enabled": true
          }
        }
    ```
      </Fragment>
    </StaticSsrTabs>

4. Preview your project locally with Wrangler.

    ```bash
    npx astro build && npx wrangler dev
    ```

5. Deploy using `npx wrangler deploy`.

    ```bash
    npx astro build && npx wrangler deploy
    ```
</Steps>

After your assets are uploaded, Wrangler will give you a preview URL to inspect your site.

### How to deploy with CI/CD

You can also use a CI/CD system such as [Workers Builds (BETA)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/) to automatically build and deploy your site on push. 

If you're using Workers Builds:

<Steps>
1. Follow Steps 1-3 from the Wrangler section above.

2. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and navigate to `Workers & Pages`. Select `Create`.

3. Under `Import a repository`, select a Git account and then the repository containing your Astro project.

4. Configure your project with:
    - Build command: `npx astro build`
    - Deploy command: `npx wrangler deploy`
    
5. Click `Save and Deploy`. You can now preview your Worker at its provided `workers.dev` subdomain.
</Steps>

## Cloudflare Pages

### How to deploy with Wrangler

<Steps>
1. Install [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/get-started/).

    ```bash
    npm install wrangler@latest --save-dev
    ```

2. If your site uses on demand rendering, install the `@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter. 
    
    This will install the adapter and make the appropriate changes to your `astro.config.mjs` file in one step.
    
      ```bash
      npx astro add cloudflare
      ```

3. Preview your project locally with Wrangler.

    ```bash
    npx astro build && npx wrangler pages dev ./dist
    ```

4. Deploy using `npx wrangler deploy`.

    ```bash
    npx astro build && npx wrangler pages deploy ./dist
    ```
</Steps>

After your assets are uploaded, Wrangler will give you a preview URL to inspect your site.

### How to deploy a site with Git

<Steps>
1. Push your code to your git repository (e.g. GitHub, GitLab).

2. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and navigate to `Workers & Pages`. Select `Create` and then select the `Pages` tab. Connect your git repository.

3. Configure your project with:
    - **Framework preset**: `Astro`
    - **Build command:** `npm run build`
    - **Build output directory:** `dist`
    
4. Click the **Save and Deploy** button.
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### Client-side hydration

Client-side hydration may fail as a result of Cloudflare's Auto Minify setting. If you see `Hydration completed but contains mismatches` in the console, make sure to disable Auto Minify under Cloudflare settings.

### Node.js runtime APIs

If you are building a project that is using on-demand rendering with [the Cloudflare SSR adapter](/en/guides/integrations-guide/cloudflare/) and the server fails to build with an error message such as `[Error] Could not resolve "XXXX. The package "XXXX" wasn't found on the file system but is built into node.`:

- This means that a package or import you are using in the server-side environment is not compatible with the [Cloudflare runtime APIs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/). 

- If you are directly importing a Node.js runtime API, please refer to the Astro documentation on Cloudflare's [Node.js compatibility](/en/guides/integrations-guide/cloudflare/#nodejs-compatibility) for further steps on how to resolve this.

- If you are importing a package that imports a Node.js runtime API, check with the author of the package to see if they support the `node:*` import syntax. If they do not, you may need to find an alternative package.
