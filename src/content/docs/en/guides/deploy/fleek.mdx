You can use [Fleek](http://fleek.xyz/) to deploy an Astro site to their edge-optimized decentralized network.

This guide gives a complete walkthrough of deploying your Astro site to Fleek using the Fleek UI and CLI.


## Project configuration

In your `astro.config.mjs`, you can configure your project to deploy to Fleek by setting the `output` to `static`:

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={5}
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

// https://astro.build/config
export default defineConfig({
    output:'static',
});
```
