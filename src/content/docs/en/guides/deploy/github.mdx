You can use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host an Astro website directly from a repository on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/).

## How to deploy

You can deploy an Astro site to GitHub Pages by using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to automatically build and deploy your site. To do this, your source code must be hosted on GitHub.

Astro maintains the official `withastro/action` to deploy your project with very little configuration. Follow the instructions below to deploy your Astro site to GitHub pages, and see [the package README](https://github.com/withastro/action) if you need more information.

## Configure Astro for GitHub Pages

### Deploying to a `github.io` URL 

Set the [`site`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#site) and [`base`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#base) options in `astro.config.mjs`.
    
```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={4-5}
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'

export default defineConfig({
  site: 'https://astronaut.github.io',
  base: 'my-repo',
})
```

#### `site`

The value for `site` must be one of the following:

- The following URL based on your username: `https://<username>.github.io`
- The random URL autogenerated for a [GitHub Organization's private page](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/changing-the-visibility-of-your-github-pages-site): `https://<random-string>.pages.github.io/`

#### `base`

A value for `base` may be required so that Astro will treat your repository name (e.g. `/my-repo`) as the root of your website.

:::note
  Don't set a `base` parameter if:

- Your page is served from the root folder.
- Your repository is located at `https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<USERNAME>.github.io`.
:::

The value for `base` should be your repository’s name starting with a forward slash, for example `/my-blog`. This is so that Astro understands your website's root is `/my-repo`, rather than the default `/`.

:::caution
    When this value is configured, all of your internal page links must be prefixed with your `base` value:

```astro ins="/my-repo"
<a href="/my-repo/about">About</a>
```

See more about [configuring a `base` value](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#base)
:::

### Using GitHub pages with a custom domain

:::tip[Set up a custom domain]
You can set up a custom domain by adding the following `./public/CNAME` file to your project: 

```js title="public/CNAME"
sub.mydomain.com
```

This will deploy your site at your custom domain instead of `user.github.io`. Don't forget to also [configure DNS for your domain provider](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-a-subdomain).   
:::

To configure Astro for using GitHub pages with a custom domain, set your domain as the value for `site`. Do not set a value for `base`:

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={4}
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'

export default defineConfig({
  site: 'https://example.com',
})
```

## Configure a GitHub Action

<Steps>
1. Create a new file in your project at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and paste in the YAML below.

    ```yaml title="deploy.yml"
    name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

    on:
      # Trigger the workflow every time you push to the `main` branch
      # Using a different branch name? Replace `main` with your branch’s name
      push:
        branches: [ main ]
      # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab on GitHub.
      workflow_dispatch:
      
    # Allow this job to clone the repo and create a page deployment
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pages: write
      id-token: write

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Checkout your repository using git
            uses: actions/checkout@v4
          - name: Install, build, and upload your site
            uses: withastro/action@v3
            # with:
              # path: . # The root location of your Astro project inside the repository. (optional)
              # node-version: 20 # The specific version of Node that should be used to build your site. Defaults to 20. (optional)
              # package-manager: pnpm@latest # The Node package manager that should be used to install dependencies and build your site. Automatically detected based on your lockfile. (optional)

      deploy:
        needs: build
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        environment:
          name: github-pages
          url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
        steps:
          - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
            id: deployment
            uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
    ```

    :::note
    The astro action takes a few optional inputs. These can be provided by uncommenting the `with:` line and the input you want to use.
    :::
    
    :::caution
    The official Astro [action](https://github.com/withastro/action) scans for a lockfile to detect your preferred package manager (`npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, or `bun`). You should commit your package manager's automatically generated `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, or `bun.lockb` file to your repository.
    :::

2. On GitHub, go to your repository’s **Settings** tab and find the **Pages** section of the settings.

3. Choose **GitHub Actions** as the **Source** of your site.  

4. Commit the new workflow file and push it to GitHub.  
</Steps>
  
Your site should now be published! When you push changes to your Astro project’s repository, the GitHub Action will automatically deploy them for you.
