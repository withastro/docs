You can deploy your Astro project to your own servers using [DeployHQ](https://www.deployhq.com/), a deployment automation platform that builds your code and pushes it to SSH/SFTP servers, FTP servers, cloud storage (Amazon S3, Cloudflare R2), and modern hosting platforms (Netlify, Heroku).

:::note
DeployHQ does not host your site. It automates building your Astro project and deploying the built files to your chosen hosting provider or server.

## How to deploy

<Steps>
1. Sign up for a [DeployHQ account](https://www.deployhq.com/) and verify your email.

2. Create your first project by clicking on **Projects** and **New Project**. Connect your Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or any private repository). Authorize DeployHQ to access your repository.

3. Add a server and enter your server details:

   - Give your server a name
   - Select your protocol (SSH/SFTP, FTP, or cloud platform)
   - Enter your server hostname, username, and password/SSH key
   - Set **Deployment Path** to your web root (e.g., `public_html/`)

4. In your project settings, navigate to **Build Pipeline** and add your build commands:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

5. Click **Deploy Project**, then select your server and click **Deploy** to start your first deployment.
</Steps>

Your Astro site will be built and deployed to your server. You can enable automatic deployments to deploy on every Git push, or schedule deployments for specific times.
