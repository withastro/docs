`.astro` files can fetch remote data to help you generate your pages.

## `fetch()` in Astro

All [Astro components](/en/basics/astro-components/) have access to the [global `fetch()` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) in their component script to make HTTP requests to APIs using the full URL (e.g. `https://example.com/api`).
Additionally, you can construct a URL to your project's pages and endpoints that are rendered on demand on the server using [`new URL("/api", Astro.url)`](/en/reference/api-reference/#url).

This fetch call will be executed at build time, and the data will be available to the component template for generating dynamic HTML. If [SSR](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/) mode is enabled, any fetch calls will be executed at runtime.

ðŸ’¡ Take advantage of [**top-level `await`**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await#top_level_await) inside of your Astro component script.

ðŸ’¡ Pass fetched data to both Astro and framework components, as props.

```astro /await fetch\\(.*?\\);/
---
// src/components/User.astro
import Contact from "../components/Contact.jsx";
import Location from "../components/Location.astro";

const response = await fetch("https://randomuser.me/api/");
const data = await response.json();
const randomUser = data.results[0];
---
<!-- Data fetched at build can be rendered in HTML -->
<h1>User</h1>
<h2>{randomUser.name.first} {randomUser.name.last}</h2>

<!-- Data fetched at build can be passed to components as props -->
<Contact client:load email={randomUser.email} />
<Location city={randomUser.location.city} />
```

:::note
Remember, all data in Astro components is fetched when a component is rendered.

Your deployed Astro site will fetch data **once, at build time**. In dev, you will see data fetches on component refreshes. If you need to re-fetch data multiple times client-side, use a [framework component](/en/guides/framework-components/) or a [client-side script](/en/guides/client-side-scripts/) in an Astro component.
:::

## `fetch()` in Framework Components

The `fetch()` function is also globally available to any [framework components](/en/guides/framework-components/):

```tsx title="src/components/Movies.tsx" /await fetch\\(.*?\\)/
import type { FunctionalComponent } from 'preact';

const data = await fetch('https://example.com/movies.json').then((response) =>
  response.json();
);

// Components that are build-time rendered also log to the CLI.
// When rendered with a `client:*` directive, they also log to the browser console.
console.log(data);

const Movies: FunctionalComponent = () => {
  // Output the result to the page
  return <div>{JSON.stringify(data)}</div>;
};

export default Movies;
```

## GraphQL queries

Astro can also use `fetch()` to query a GraphQL server with any valid GraphQL query.

```astro title="src/components/Film.astro" "await fetch"
---
const response = await fetch(
  "https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/index",
  {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      query: `
        query getFilm ($id:ID!) {
          film(id: $id) {
            title
            releaseDate
          }
        }
      `,
      variables: {
        id: "ZmlsbXM6MQ==",
      },
    }),
  }
);


const json = await response.json();
const { film } = json.data;
---
<h1>Fetching information about Star Wars: A New Hope</h1>
<h2>Title: {film.title}</h2>
<p>Year: {film.releaseDate}</p>
```

## Fetch from a Headless CMS

Astro components can fetch data from your favorite CMS and then render it as your page content. Using [dynamic routes](/en/guides/routing/#dynamic-routes), components can even generate pages based on your CMS content.

See our [CMS Guides](/en/guides/cms/) for full details on integrating Astro with headless CMSes including Storyblok, Contentful, and WordPress.
