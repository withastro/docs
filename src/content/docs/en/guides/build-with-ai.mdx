AI-powered editors and agentic coding tools have become increasingly powerful for web development. They generally have good knowledge of Astro's core APIs and concepts, but tend to use older APIs and may not be aware of newer features, current best practices, or recent changes to the framework.

This guide covers how to enhance AI tools with up-to-date Astro knowledge, and provides best practices for building Astro sites with AI assistance.

## AI Support Resources

### `llms.txt`

Astro provides [`llms.txt`](https://docs.astro.build/llms.txt) and [`llms-full.txt`](https://docs.astro.build/llms-full.txt) files that contains the full docs content in a format optimized for AI consumption. Some AI tools can auto-discover these files if you tell them to use `docs.astro.build`.  These are large files which will use a lot of tokens, and [the MCP server](#the-astro-docs-mcp-server) provides more efficient access to the full documentation with real-time search capabilities, making it the preferred option when available.

## The Astro Docs MCP Server

The most effective way to ensure AI tools have current Astro knowledge is through the Astro Docs MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. This provides real-time access to the latest documentation, helping AI tools avoid outdated recommendations and ensuring they understand current best practices.

:::tip[What is MCP?]
[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) is a standardized way for AI tools to access external tools and data sources.
:::

Unlike AI models trained on static data, the MCP server provides access to the latest Astro documentation. The server is free, open-source, and runs remotely with nothing to install locally.

The Astro Docs MCP server uses the [Kapa](https://www.kapa.ai/) API to maintain an up-to-date index of the Astro documentation. 

## Server Details

- **Name**: Astro Docs
- **URL**: `https://mcp.docs.astro.build/mcp`
- **Transport**: Streamable HTTP

This server uses streamable HTTP transport, which may not be compatible with all tools. Check your tool's documentation for MCP support.

## Installation

The setup process varies depending on your AI development tool. You may see some tools refer to MCP servers as connectors, adapters, extensions or plugins.

### Claude Code

[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) is an agentic coding tool that runs on the command line. Enabling the Astro Docs MCP server allows it to access the latest documentation while generating Astro code.

Install using the terminal command:

```shell
claude mcp add --transport http "Astro docs" https://mcp.docs.astro.build/mcp
```

### Cursor

[Cursor](https://cursor.com) is an AI code editor. Adding the Astro Docs MCP server allows Cursor to access the latest Astro documentation while performing development tasks.

<Steps>

1. Click [Add to Cursor](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=Astro%20docs&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL21jcC5kb2NzLmFzdHJvLmJ1aWxkL21jcCJ9)
2. Click "Install" when prompted

</Steps>

### Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) supports MCP servers when using Copilot Chat. Adding the Astro Docs MCP server allows VS Code to access the latest Astro documentation when answering questions or performing coding tasks.

<Steps>

1. Click [Add to VS Code](vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22Astro%20docs%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fmcp.docs.astro.build%2Fmcp%22%7D)
2. Click "Install" when prompted

</Steps>

### Claude.ai / Claude Desktop

[Claude.ai](https://claude.ai) is a general-purpose AI assistant. Adding the Astro Docs MCP server allows it to access the latest documentation when answering Astro questions or generating Astro code.

<Steps>

1. Navigate to the [Claude.ai connector settings](https://claude.ai/settings/connectors)
2. Click "Add custom connector". You may need to scroll down to find this option.
3. Enter the server URL: `https://mcp.docs.astro.build/mcp`
4. Set the name to "Astro docs"

</Steps>

### Windsurf

[Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/) is an AI-powered agentic coding tool, available as editor plugins or a standalone editor. It can use the Astro Docs MCP server to access documentation while performing coding tasks.

Windsurf doesn't support streaming HTTP, so requires a local proxy configuration:

<Steps>

1. Open `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` in your editor.
2. Add the following configuration to your Windsurf MCP settings:

   ```json title="MCP Configuration" {3-6}
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "Astro docs": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.docs.astro.build/mcp"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Save the configuration and restart Windsurf

</Steps>

### ChatGPT

:::caution[Limited availability]
MCP server integration is only available for ChatGPT Pro, Team, and Enterprise users. The setup process is more complex than other tools.
:::

Refer to the [OpenAI MCP documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/mcp#test-and-connect-your-mcp-server) for specific setup instructions.

## Usage

Once configured, you can ask your AI tool questions about Astro, and it will retrieve information directly from the latest docs. Coding agents will be able to consult the latest documentation when performing coding tasks, and chat bots will be able to accurately answer questions about Astro features, APIs, and best practices.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Verify your tool supports streamable HTTP transport
- Check that the server URL is correct: `https://mcp.docs.astro.build/mcp`
- Ensure your tool has proper internet access
- Consult your specific tool's MCP integration documentation
- If you are still having problems, open an issue in the [Astro Docs MCP Server repository](https://github.com/withastro/docs-mcp/issues)

:::note[Remember]
The Astro Docs MCP server provides access to current documentation, but your AI tools are still responsible for interpretation and code generation. AI makes mistakes, so always review generated code carefully and test thoroughly.
:::

### Discord AI Support

As well as the friendly and knowledgable community support squad in the [Astro Discord](https://astro.build/chat), it also features an AI-powered support channel where you can get help with Astro-specific questions. This bot is powered by the same technology as the MCP server and has access to the latest documentation.

## Tips for AI-Powered Astro Development

### Start with Templates
Rather than building from scratch, ask AI tools to start with an existing [Astro template](https://astro.build/themes/) or use `npm create astro@latest` with a template option.

### Use `astro add` for Integrations
Ask AI tools to use `astro add` for official integrations (`astro add tailwind`, `astro add react`). For other packages, intall using the package manager rather than editing `package.json` directly.

### Verify Current APIs
AI tools may use outdated patterns. Ask them to check the latest documentation, especially for newer features like Sessions, Actions and Content Collections, and particularly for experimental features which may have changed and may no longer be experimental.

### Use project rules
If your AI tool supports it, set up project rules to enforce best practices and coding standards, such as the ones listed above.
