**Middleware** is enabled in Astro behind an experimental flag. Middleware allows you to intercept requests and responses and inject behaviors dynamically every time a page or endpoint is about to be rendered. 

This also allows you to set and share request-specific information across endpoints and pages by mutating a `locals` object that is available in all Astro components and API endpoints

Middleware is available in both SSG and SSR Astro projects.

## Basic Usage

1. Create `src/middleware.js|ts` (Alternatively, you can create `src/middleware/index.js|ts`.)

2. Inside this file, export an [`onRequest()`](#onrequest) function. This must not be a default export.

    ```js title="src/middleware.js"
    export function onRequest ({ locals, request }, next) {
        // intercept response data from a request
      // optionally, transform the response by modifying `locals`
      locals.title = "New title"

      // return a Response or the result of calling `next()`
      return next()
    };
    ```

3. Inside any `.astro` file, access response data using `Astro.locals`

```astro title="src/components/Component.astro"
---
const data = Astro.locals;
---
<h1>{data.title}</h1>
<p>This {data.property} is from middleware.</p>

```

### Middleware types

You can import and use the utility function `defineMiddleware()` to take advantage of type safety:


```ts tilte="src/middleware.ts"
import { defineMiddleware } from "astro/middleware";

// `context` and `next` are automatically typed
export const onRequest = defineMiddleware((context, next) => {

})
```

Instead, if you're using JsDoc to take advantage of type safety, you can use `MiddlewareRequestHandler`:

```js tilte="src/middleware.js"

/**
 * @type import("astro").MiddlewareResponseHandler
 */
// `context` and `next` are automatically typed
export const onRequest = (context, next) => {

}

```

### Example: redacting sensitive information

The example below uses middleware to replace "PRIVATE INFO" with the word "REDACTED" to allow you to render modified HTML on your page:

```js
export const onRequest = async (context, next) => {
   const response = await next();
   const html = response.text();
   const redactedHtml = html.replace("PRIVATE INFO", "REDACTED");
   
   return new Response(redactedHtml, {
     status: 200,
     headers: response.headers
   });
}
```
For more usage examples, please see [the middleware RFC proposal](https://github.com/withastro/roadmap/blob/rfc/stage-3-middleware/proposals/0032-middleware-api.md#middleware-workflow-and-examples)

### Chaining middleware

Multiple middlewares can be joined, in a specified order, using [`sequence()`](#sequence):

```js title="src/middleware.js"
import {sequence} from "astro/middleware";

function validation() {}
function auth() {}

export const onRequest = sequence(validation, auth);
```

```js
import {sequence} from "astro/middleware";

async function validation(_, next) {
    console.log("validation request");
    const response = await next();
    console.log("validation response");
    return response;
}
async function auth(_, next) {
  console.log("auth request");
  const response = await next();
  console.log("auth response");
  return response;

}
async function greeting(_, next) {
  console.log("greeting request");
  const response = await next();
  console.log("greeting response");
  return response;

}

export const onRequest = sequence(validation, auth, greeting);
```

This will result in the following console order:

```sh
validation request
auth request
greeting request
greeting response
auth response
validation response
```

## API reference

### `onRequest()`

A required exported function from `src/middleware.js` that will be called before rendering every page or API route. It accepts two optional arguments: [context](#context) and [next()](#next). `onRequest()` must return a `Response`: either directly, or by calling `next()`.

### `context`

An object that includes information to be made available to other middleware, API routes and `.astro` routes during the rendering process.

This is an optional argument passed to `onRequest()` that may contain the [`locals`](#locals) object as well as any additional properties to be shared during rendering. For example, the `context` object may include cookies used in authentication.

This is the same `context` object that is passed to API routes.

### `next()`

A function that intercepts (reads and modifies) the `Response` of a `Request` or calls the "next" middleware in the chain and returns a `Response`. For example, this function could modify the HTML body of a response.

This is an optional argument of `onRequest()`, and may provide the required `Response` returned by the middleware.

### `locals`
An object containing data from a `Response` that can be manipulated inside middleware. 

This `locals` object is forwarded across the request handling process and is available as a property to `APIContext` and `AstroGlobal`. This allows data to be shared between middlewares, API routes, and .astro pages. This is useful for storing request-specific data, such as user data, across the rendering step.

`locals` is an object that lives and dies within a single Astro route; when your route page is rendered, `locals` won't exist anymore and a new one will be created. Information that needs to persist across multiple page requests must be stored elsewhere.

:::note
The value of `locals` cannot be overridden at run time. Doing so would risk wiping out all the information stored by the user.  In `dev` mode, Astro performs checks and will throw an error if `locals` are overridden.
:::

### `sequence()`

A function that accepts middleware functions as arguments, and will execute them in the order in which they are passed.
