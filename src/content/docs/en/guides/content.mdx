Astro is a perfect choice for your content-focused site: blogs, marketing sites, portfolios, and more!

Astro helps you author, organize and present your content. You can write a blog post directly in Astro using Markdown/MDX, or fetch your content from a headless CMS. Astro lets you build a site around your content: you can add a layout to your pages, create an index of articles, and set up an RSS feed to allow readers to subscribe.

## Writing Content

In Astro, you can author your content in a variety of ways: 
- In Markdown files (`.md` or alternative extensions), designed to make it easy to write rich text content.
- In MDX (`.mdx`) or Markdoc (`.mdoc`) files with [an official integration](/en/guides/integrations-guide/), which can include components and dynamic expressions in your document.
- Using a [third-party content management system (CMS)](#headless-cms-authoring), then pulling that content into a `.astro` page.
- Other options (less commonly used for content-heavy pages) include [`.astro` files](/en/basics/astro-pages/#astro-pages) and [`.html` files](/en/basics/astro-pages/#html-pages).

### Markdown Authoring
Markdown is a convenient syntax for writing rich text with basic formatting and common elements like headers, lists, and images. Astro has built-in support for Markdown files in your project.

Create and write a new `.md` file in your code editor or bring in an existing file written in your favorite Markdown editor. Some online Markdown editors like [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) and [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io) will even allow you to edit and sync your work with your Astro repository stored on GitHub.

### MDX Authoring
If you add the [Astro MDX integration](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) to your project, you can also write content using `.mdx` files, which can include JavaScript expressions and components within your Markdown. This includes both static [Astro components](/en/basics/astro-components/) and interactive [framework components](/en/guides/framework-components/). This allows you to include UI elements such as a banner or an interactive carousel along with your text content.

Write and edit `.mdx` files directly in your code editor, alongside your project files. MDX files are a [supported page file type](/en/basics/astro-pages/#supported-page-files) in Astro, and may also be used as [content collection entries](#content-collections).

### Headless CMS Authoring

Write blog posts in your existing Content Management System (CMS) such as Storyblok, WordPress, or Contentful. Some CMSes, like Storyblok, provide an official [Astro integration](https://www.storyblok.com/mp/announcing-storyblok-astro). Others expose a JavaScript SDK that Astro pages can use to [fetch your remote content](/en/guides/data-fetching/#fetch-from-a-headless-cms).

## Managing content pages

### Page files

Markdown and MDX files that live in your `src/pages` directory will automatically generate pages on your site using Astro's [file-based routing](/en/guides/routing/), built at a URL corresponding to the post's file path. 

### Local content

You can also choose to keep your Markdown and MDX files outside of the `src/pages` directory, and instead [import their content](/en/guides/markdown-content/#importing-markdown) into `.astro` pages.

### Content collections

Astro's own [content collections](/en/guides/content-collections/) provide a powerful, type-safe way to work with Markdown, MDX, or Markdoc content organized in the `src/content/` directory. 

### Remote content

You can also [fetch markdown remotely](/en/guides/markdown-content/#fetching-remote-markdown) from a source outside of your project. This will require your own Markdown parser, or a community integration (e.g. [`astro-remote`](https://github.com/natemoo-re/astro-remote)).

## Showcasing your content

To build common features to organize and display your content, such as a blog archive or a page for each blog tag, Astro allows you to [fetch filenames and metadata](/en/reference/api-reference/#astroglob) from your Markdown and MDX frontmatter or use [content collection helper utilities](/en/guides/content-collections/#querying-collections) to query your entries and generate page content and routes.

To publish to a broader audience, [create an RSS feed](/en/guides/rss/) that can be distributed to feed readers.

## Community Integrations

In addition to the official [`@astrojs/mdx`](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) and [`@astrojs/markdoc`](/en/guides/integrations-guide/markdoc/) integrations, there are several third-party [community integrations](https://astro.build/integrations/?search=content) for working with content in your Astro project.
