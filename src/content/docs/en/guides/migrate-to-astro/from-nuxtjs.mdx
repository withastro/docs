[NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org) is a framework for building web applications on top of Vue.

## Key Similarities between Nuxt and Astro

Nuxt and Astro share some similarities that will help you migrate your project:

- Both Nuxt and Astro are modern Javascript static-site generators with similar project file structures.

- Both Nuxt and Astro use a [`src/` folder for your project files](/en/core-concepts/project-structure/#src) and a [special `src/pages/` folder for file-based routing](/en/core-concepts/astro-pages/). Creating and managing pages for your site should feel familiar.

- Astro has [an official integration for using Vue components](/en/guides/integrations-guide/vue/) and supports [installing NPM packages](/en/guides/imports/#npm-packages), including several for Vue. You will be able to write Vue UI components, and may be able to keep some or all of your existing components and dependencies.

- Astro and Nuxt both allow you to use a [headless CMS, APIs or Markdown files for data](/en/guides/data-fetching/). You can continue to use your preferred [content authoring](/en/guides/content/) system, and will be able to keep your existing content.

## Key Differences between Nuxt and Astro

When you rebuild your Nuxt site in Astro, you will notice some important differences:

- [MPA vs SPA](/en/concepts/mpa-vs-spa/): Nuxt is a Vue-based SPA (single-page application). Astro sites are multi-page apps built using [`.astro` components](/en/core-concepts/astro-components/), but can also support [React, Preact, Vue.js, Svelte, SolidJS, AlpineJS, Lit](/en/core-concepts/framework-components/) and raw HTML templating.

- [Page Routing](/en/core-concepts/astro-pages/#file-based-routing): Nuxt uses `vue-router` for SPA routing, and `vue-meta` for managing `<head>`. In Astro, you will create separate HTML page routes and control your page `<head>` directly, or in a layout component.

- [Content-focus](/en/concepts/why-astro/): Astro was designed to excel at making content-focused websites. An existing Nuxt app might be built for high client-side interactivity and may include items that are difficult to replicate in Astro, such as dashboards.

## Switch from Nuxt to Astro

To convert a Nuxt blog to Astro, start with our official blog theme starter template, or explore more community blog themes in our [theme showcase](https://astro.build/themes/). 

You can pass a `--template` argument to the `create astro` command to start a new Astro project with one of our official starters. Or, you can [start a new project from any existing Astro repository on GitHub](/en/install/auto/#starter-templates).

  <PackageManagerTabs>
    <Fragment slot="npm">
    ```shell
    npm create astro@latest -- --template blog
    ```
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="pnpm">
    ```shell
    pnpm create astro@latest --template blog
    ```
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="yarn">
    ```shell
    yarn create astro --template blog
    ```
    </Fragment>
  </PackageManagerTabs>

Bring your existing Markdown (or MDX, with our optional integration) files as content to [create Markdown or MDX pages](/en/guides/markdown-content/).

While file-based routing and layout components are similar in Astro, you may wish to read about [Astro's project structure](/en/core-concepts/project-structure/) to learn where files should be located. For example, Astro uses a `public/` folder outside of `src/` for static assets.

To convert other types of sites, such as a portfolio or documentation site, see more official starter templates on [astro.new](https://astro.new). You'll find a link to each project's GitHub repository, as well as one-click links to open a working project in StackBlitz, CodeSandbox and Gitpod online development environments.
