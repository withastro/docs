[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) is a framework for building web applications on top of React.

## Key Similarities

Next.js and Astro share some similarities that will help you migrate your project:

- [Astro's JSX-like syntax](/en/core-concepts/astro-components/#the-component-template) should feel familiar if you are used to writing React.

- Both Next.js and Astro are modern Javascript static-site generators. Both use a [`src/` folder for your project files](/en/core-concepts/project-structure/#src) and a [special folder for file-based routing](/en/core-concepts/astro-pages/). Creating and managing pages for your site should feel familiar.

- Astro has an [official integration for using React components](/en/guides/integrations-guide/react/). Note that in Astro, React files **must** have a `.jsx` or `.tsx` extension.

- Astro supports [installing NPM packages](/en/guides/imports/#npm-packages), including several for React. You may be able to keep some or all of your existing React components and dependencies.


- Astro projects can also be SSG or [SSR](/en/guides/server-side-rendering/). (Support for per-page rendering strategy is planned.)


## Key Differences

When you rebuild your Next.js site in Astro, you will notice some important differences:

- [MPA vs SPA](/en/concepts/mpa-vs-spa/): Next.js is a React-based SPA (single-page application). Astro sites are multi-page apps built using `.astro` components, but can also support React, Preact, Vue.js, Svelte, SolidJS, AlpineJS, Lit and raw HTML templating.

- [Astro components](/en/core-concepts/astro-components/) are not written as exported functions that return page templating. Instead, you'll split your code into a "code fence" and a body exclusively for the HTML you generate.

- [Content-focus](/en/concepts/why-astro/): Astro was designed to excel at making content-focused websites. An existing Next.js app might be built for high client-side interactivity and may include items that are difficult to replicate in Astro, such as dashboards.


## Switch from Next.js to Astro

To convert a Next.js blog to Astro, start with our official blog theme starter template, or explore more community blog themes in our [theme showcase](https://astro.build/themes/). 

You can pass a `--template` argument to the `create astro` command to start a new Astro project with one of our official starters. Or, you can [start a new project from any existing Astro repository on GitHub](/en/install/auto/#starter-templates).

  <PackageManagerTabs>
    <Fragment slot="npm">
    ```shell
    npm create astro@latest -- --template blog
    ```
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="pnpm">
    ```shell
    pnpm create astro@latest --template blog
    ```
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="yarn">
    ```shell
    yarn create astro --template blog
    ```
    </Fragment>
  </PackageManagerTabs>

Bring your existing Markdown (or MDX, with our optional integration) files as content to [create Markdown or MDX pages](/en/guides/markdown-content/).

While file-based routing and layout components are similar in Astro, you may wish to read about [Astro's project structure](/en/core-concepts/project-structure/) to learn where files should be located. For example, Astro uses a `public/` folder outside of `src/` for static assets.

To convert other types of sites, such as a portfolio or documentation site, see more official starter templates on [astro.new](https://astro.new). You'll find a link to each project's GitHub repository, as well as one-click links to open a working project in StackBlitz, CodeSandbox and Gitpod online development environments.
