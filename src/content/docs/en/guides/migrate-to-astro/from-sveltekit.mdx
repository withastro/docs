[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) is a framework for building web applications on top of Svelte.

## Key Similarities between SvelteKit and Astro

SvelteKit and Astro share some similarities that will help you migrate your project:

- Both SvelteKit and Astro are modern JavaScript static-site generators and server-side rendering frameworks. 

- Both SvelteKit and Astro use a [`src/` folder for your project files](/en/core-concepts/project-structure/#src) and a [special folder for file-based routing](/en/core-concepts/astro-pages/). Creating and managing pages for your site should feel familiar.

- Astro has [an official integration for using Svelte components](/en/guides/integrations-guide/svelte/) and supports [installing NPM packages](/en/guides/imports/#npm-packages), including several for Svelte. You will be able to write Svelte UI components, and may be able to keep some or all of your existing components and dependencies.

- Astro and SvelteKit both allow you to use a [headless CMS, APIs or Markdown files for data](/en/guides/data-fetching/). You can continue to use your preferred [content authoring](/en/guides/content/) system, and will be able to keep your existing content.

## Key Differences between SvelteKit and Astro

When you rebuild your SvelteKit site in Astro, you will notice some important differences:

- Astro sites are multi-page apps, whereas SvelteKit defaults to SPAs (single-page applications) with server-side rendering, but can also create MPAs, traditional SPAs, or you can mix and match these techniques within an app.

- [Components](/en/core-concepts/astro-components/): SvelteKit uses [Svelte](https://svelte.dev). Astro pages are built using [`.astro` components](/en/core-concepts/astro-components/), but can also support [React, Preact, Vue.js, Svelte, SolidJS, AlpineJS, Lit](/en/core-concepts/framework-components/) and raw HTML templating.

- [Content-first](/en/concepts/why-astro/): Astro was designed to showcase your content and to allow you to opt-in to interactivity only as needed. An existing SvelteKit app might be built for high client-side interactivity. Astro has built-in capabilities for working with your content, such as page generation, but may require advanced Astro techniques to include items that are more challenging to replicate using `.astro` components, such as dashboards.

- [Markdown-ready](/en/guides/markdown-content/): Astro includes built-in Markdown support, and includes a [special frontmatter YAML `layout` property](/en/core-concepts/layouts/#markdownmdx-layouts) used per-file for page templating. If you are converting a SvelteKit Markdown-based blog, you will not have to install a separate Markdown integration and you will not set a layout via a configuration file. You can bring your existing Markdown files, but you may need to reorganize as Astro's file-based routing does not require a folder for each page route.


## Switch from SvelteKit to Astro

To convert a SvelteKit blog to Astro, start with our blog theme starter template, or explore more community blog themes in our [theme showcase](https://astro.build/themes/).

You can pass a `--template` argument to the `create astro` command to start a new Astro project with one of our official starters. Or, you can [start a new project from any existing Astro repository on GitHub](/en/install/auto/#starter-templates).

  <PackageManagerTabs>
    <Fragment slot="npm">
    ```shell
    npm create astro@latest -- --template blog
    ```
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="pnpm">
    ```shell
    pnpm create astro@latest --template blog
    ```
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="yarn">
    ```shell
    yarn create astro --template blog
    ```
    </Fragment>
  </PackageManagerTabs>

Bring your existing Markdown (or MDX, with our optional integration) files as content to [create Markdown or MDX pages](/en/guides/markdown-content/).

While file-based routing and layout components are similar in Astro, you may wish to read about [Astro's project structure](/en/core-concepts/project-structure/) to learn where files should be located.

To convert other types of sites, such as a portfolio or documentation site, see more official starter templates on [astro.new](https://astro.new). You'll find a link to each project's GitHub repository, as well as one-click links to open a working project in StackBlitz, CodeSandbox and Gitpod online development environments.
