Individual collections are defined using `defineCollection()` to define:
- a `loader` for a data source (required)
- a `schema` for type safety (optional, but highly recommended!) 

## The collection config file

To define collections, you must create a `src/content/config.ts` file in your project (`.js` and `.mjs` extensions are also supported.) This is a special file that Astro will use to configure your content collections based on the following structure:

```ts title="src/content/config.ts"
// 1. Import utilities from `astro:content`
import { defineCollection, z } from 'astro:content';

// 2. Import loader(s)
import { glob, file } from 'astro/loaders'; // Not available with legacy API

// 3. Define your collection(s)
const blog = defineCollection({ /* ... */ });
const dogs = defineCollection({ /* ... */ });

// 4. Export a single `collections` object to register your collection(s)
export const collections = { blog, dogs };
```

## Defining the collection `loader`

The Content Layer API allows you to fetch your content from outside of the `src/content/` folder (whether stored locally in your project or remotely) and uses a `loader` property to retrieve your data. Collections stored inside `src/content/` will be treated as legacy collections that do not use a loader to fetch content.

The `loader` is defined in the collection's schema and returns an array of entries.

### Built-in loaders

Astro provides two built-in loader functions (`glob()` and `file()`) for fetching your local content, as well as access to the API to construct your own loader and fetch remote data.

The `glob()` loader creates entries from directories of Markdown, MDX, Markdoc, or JSON files from anywhere on the filesystem. It accepts a `pattern` of entry files to match, and a `base` file path of where your files are located. Use this when you have one file per entry.

The `file()` loader creates multiple entries from a single local file. Use this when all your entries are stored in an array of objects.

```ts  title="src/content/config.ts" {5,9}
import { defineCollection, z } from 'astro:content';
import { glob, file } from 'astro/loaders'; // Not available with legacy API

const blog = defineCollection({
  loader: glob({ pattern: "**\/*.md", base: "./src/data/blog" }),
  schema: /* ... */ 
});
const dogs = defineCollection({
  loader: file("src/data/dogs.json"),
  schema: /* ... */ 
  }),
});

export const collections = { blog, dogs };
```
### Building a custom loader 

You can build a custom loader to fetch remote content from any data source, such as a CMS, a database, or an API endpoint.

Using a loader to fetch your data will automatically create a collection from your remote data. This gives you all the benefits of local collections, such as collection-specific API helpers such as `getCollection()` and `render()` to query and display your data, as well as schema validation.

#### Inline loaders

You can define a loader inline, inside your collection, as an async function that returns an array of entries.

This is useful for loaders that don't need to manually control how the data is loaded and stored. Whenever the loader is called, it will clear the store and reload all the entries.

```ts title="src/content/config.ts"
const countries = defineCollection({
  loader: async () => {
    const response = await fetch("https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all");
    const data = await response.json();
    // Must return an array of entries with an id property, or an object with IDs as keys and entries as values
    return data.map((country) => ({
      id: country.cca3,
      ...country,
    }));
  },
  schema: /* ... */
});
```

The returned entries are stored in the collection, and can be queried using the getCollection() and getEntry() functions.

#### Loader objects

For more control over the loading process, you can use the Loader API to create a loader object. For example, with access to the `load` method directly, you can create a loader that allows entries to be updated incrementally, or clears the store only when necessary.

Similar to creating an Astro integration or Vite plugin, you can [distribute your loader as an NPM package](/en/reference/publish-to-npm/) that others can use in their projects.

## Defining the collection schema

Schemas enforce consistent frontmatter or entry data within a collection through Zod validation. A schema **guarantees** that this data exists in a predictable form when you need to reference or query it. If any file violates its collection schema, Astro will provide a helpful error to let you know.

Schemas also power Astro's automatic TypeScript typings for your content. When you define a schema for your collection, Astro will automatically generate and apply a TypeScript interface to it. The result is full TypeScript support when you query your collection, including property autocompletion and type-checking.

Every frontmatter or data property of your collection entries must be defined using a Zod data type:

```ts title="src/content/config.ts" {6-11,15-19}
import { defineCollection, z } from 'astro:content';
import { glob, file } from 'astro/loaders'; // Not available with legacy API

const blog = defineCollection({
  loader: glob({ pattern: "**\/*.md", base: "./src/data/blog" }),
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    description: z.string(),
    pubDate: z.coerce.date(),
    updatedDate: z.coerce.date().optional(),
  })
});
const dogs = defineCollection({
  loader: file("src/data/dogs.json"),
  schema: z.object({
    id: z.string(),
    breed: z.string(),
    temperament: z.array(z.string()),
  }),
});

export const collections = { blog, dogs };
```

### Defining datatypes with Zod

Astro uses [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) to power its content schemas. With Zod, Astro is able to validate every file's data within a collection *and* provide automatic TypeScript types when you go to query content from inside your project.

To use Zod in Astro, import the `z` utility from `"astro:content"`. This is a re-export of the Zod library, and it supports all of the features of Zod. 

```ts
// Example: A cheatsheet of many common Zod datatypes
import { z, defineCollection } from 'astro:content';

defineCollection({
  schema: z.object({
    isDraft: z.boolean(),
    title: z.string(),
    sortOrder: z.number(),
    image: z.object({
      src: z.string(),
      alt: z.string(),
    }),
    author: z.string().default('Anonymous'),
    language: z.enum(['en', 'es']),
    tags: z.array(z.string()),
    footnote: z.string().optional(),

    // In YAML, dates written without quotes around them are interpreted as Date objects
    publishDate: z.date(), // e.g. 2024-09-17

    // Transform a date string (e.g. "2022-07-08") to a Date object
    updatedDate: z.string().transform((str) => new Date(str)),

    authorContact: z.string().email(),
    canonicalURL: z.string().url(),
  })
})
```

### Defining collection references

Collection entries can also "reference" other related entries. 

With the `reference()` function from the Collections API, you can define a property in a collection schema as an entry from another collection. For example, you can require that every `space-shuttle` entry includes a `pilot` property which uses the `pilot` collection's own schema for type checking, autocomplete, and validation.

A common example is a blog post that references reusable author profiles stored as JSON, or related post URLs stored in the same collection:

```ts title="src/content/config.ts"
import { defineCollection, reference, z } from 'astro:content';

const blog = defineCollection({
  loader: glob({ pattern: '**\/[^_]*.md', base: "./src/data/blog" }),
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    // Reference a single author from the `authors` collection by `id`
    author: reference('authors'),
    // Reference an array of related posts from the `blog` collection by `slug`
    relatedPosts: z.array(reference('blog')),
  })
});

const authors = defineCollection({
  loader: glob({ pattern: '**\/[^_]*.json', base: "./src/data/authors" }),
  schema: z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    portfolio: z.string().url(),
  })
});

export const collections = { blog, authors };
```

This example blog post specifies the `id`s of related posts and the `id` of the post author:

```yaml title="src/data/blog/welcome.md"
---
title: "Welcome to my blog"
author: ben-holmes # references `src/data/authors/ben-holmes.json` 
relatedPosts:
- about-me # references `src/data/blog/about-me.md`
- my-year-in-review # references `src/data/blog/my-year-in-review.md`
---
```
