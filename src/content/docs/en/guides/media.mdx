## Why use a DAM or hosted media?

Using a DAM, or Digital Asset Manager, helps individual, teams, and organizations manage their image and video assets from a central location much like a [CMS](/en/guides/cms).

The difference is the type of content being managed, where a DAM would be primarily made up of images, videos, other media assets like 3D models, and any metadata associated with those assets.

This can be useful particularly when using a single source of truth for your assets between multiple web or mobile properties, if you're part of an organization that requires multiple teams to utilize the assets, or integrating into other content systems like a PIM (Product Information Manager) to connect your assets to products.

## Which hosted media systems or DAMs work well with Astro?

Much like a CMS, because Astro manages the _presentation_ of your content, you'll want to use a headless DAM, that allows you to fetch and interact with your assets via an API or SDK.

Some headless DAMs, like Cloudinary, provide an Astro [integration](/en/guides/integrations-guide/) that allow you to easily fetch your assets as well as display them in your website or app.

## Can I use Astro without a hosted media system or DAM?

Yes! Astro provides built-in ways to [store images](/en/guides/images/#where-to-store-images), including support for referencing remote images.
