<DontEditWarning/>

This **[Astro integration][astro-integration]** adds [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) to your project so that you can use Alpine.js anywhere on your page.

## Installation

### Quick Install

The `astro add` command-line tool automates the installation for you. Run one of the following commands in a new terminal window. (If you aren't sure which package manager you're using, run the first command.) Then, follow the prompts, and type "y" in the terminal (meaning "yes") for each one.

```sh
# Using NPM
npx astro add alpinejs
# Using Yarn
yarn astro add alpinejs
# Using PNPM
pnpm astro add alpinejs
```

If you run into any issues, [feel free to report them to us on GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues) and try the manual installation steps below.

### Manual Install

First, install the `@astrojs/alpinejs` package using your package manager. If you're using npm or aren't sure, run this in the terminal:

```sh
npm install @astrojs/alpinejs
```

Most package managers will install associated peer dependencies as well. However, if you see a "Cannot find package 'alpinejs'" (or similar) warning when you start up Astro, you'll need to manually install Alpine.js yourself:

```sh
npm install alpinejs @types/alpinejs
```

Then, apply this integration to your `astro.config.*` file using the `integrations` property:

```diff lang="js" "alpine()"
  // astro.config.mjs
  import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
+ import alpine from '@astrojs/alpinejs';
  
  export default defineConfig({
    // ...
    integrations: [alpine()],
    //             ^^^^^^^^
  });
```

## Usage

Once the integration is installed, you can use [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) directives and syntax inside any Astro component. The Alpine.js script is automatically added and enabled on every page of your website.

Check our [Astro Integration Documentation][astro-integration] for more on integrations.

## Limitations

The Alpine.js integration does not give you control over how the script is loaded or initialized. If you require this control, consider [installing and using Alpine.js manually](https://alpinejs.dev/essentials/installation). Astro supports all officially documented Alpine.js manual setup instructions, using `<script>` tags inside of an Astro component.

**It is not currently possible to [extend Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/advanced/extending) when using this component.** If you need this feature, consider following [the manual Alpine.js setup](https://alpinejs.dev/essentials/installation) instead using an Astro script tag:

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
<!-- Example: Load AlpineJS on a single page. -->
<script>
  import Alpine from 'alpinejs';

  // Optional: Extend Alpine.js
  // Alpine.directive('foo', ...)

  window.Alpine = Alpine;
  Alpine.start();
</script>
```

## Configuration

The Alpine.js integration does not support any custom configuration at this time.

## Examples

*   The [Astro Alpine.js example](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/latest/examples/framework-alpine) shows how to use Alpine.js in an Astro project.
