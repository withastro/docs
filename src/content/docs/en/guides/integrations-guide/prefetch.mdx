:::note[removed]
`@astrojs/prefetch` has been replaced by the [built-in `prefetch` feature](/en/guides/prefetch/) introduced in Astro 3.5. See the [migration guide](/en/guides/prefetch/#migrating-from-astrojsprefetch) for instructions on updating an older project.

If you still are using this integration in pre-v3.5 Astro project, you can find [its previous documentation](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/c47478bbf6b21973419f25234c68efb59466b368/packages%2Fintegrations%2Fprefetch%2FREADME.md) from an older version of Astro.
