:::caution[Deprecated]
This Astro integration to enable on-demand rendering and client-side hydration for your [Lit](https://lit.dev/) custom elements was deprecated in Astro 5.0.
:::

You can continue to use Lit for client components by adding a client-side script tag. For example:

```astro
<script>
  import "../components/MyTabs";
</script>

<my-tabs title="These are my tabs">...</my-tabs>
```

If you're interested in maintaining a Lit integration yourself, you may wish to use the [last published version of `@astrojs/lit`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/astro%404.13.0/packages/integrations/lit) as a starting point and upgrade the relevant packages.
