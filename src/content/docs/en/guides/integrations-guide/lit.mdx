This **[Astro integration][astro-integration]** enables server-side rendering and client-side hydration for your [Lit](https://lit.dev/) custom elements.

## Installation

Astro includes an `astro add` command to automate the setup of official integrations. If you prefer, you can [install integrations manually](#manual-install) instead.

To install `@astrojs/lit`, run the following from your project directory and follow the prompts:

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
    ```sh
    npx astro add lit
    ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
    ```sh
    pnpm astro add lit
    ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
    ```sh
    yarn astro add lit
    ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

If you run into any issues, [feel free to report them to us on GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues) and try the manual installation steps below.

### Manual Install

First, install the `@astrojs/lit` package:

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```sh
  npm install @astrojs/lit
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```sh
  pnpm add @astrojs/lit
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```sh
  yarn add @astrojs/lit
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

Most package managers will install associated peer dependencies as well. If you see a "Cannot find package 'lit'" (or similar) warning when you start up Astro, you'll need to install `lit` and `@webcomponents/template-shadowroot`:

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```sh
  npm install lit @webcomponents/template-shadowroot
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```sh
  pnpm add lit @webcomponents/template-shadowroot
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```sh
  yarn add lit @webcomponents/template-shadowroot
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

Then, apply the integration to your `astro.config.*` file using the `integrations` property:

```js ins={2} ins="lit()" title="astro.config.mjs"
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import lit from '@astrojs/lit';

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  integrations: [lit()],
});
```

## Getting started

To use your first Lit component in Astro, head to our [UI framework documentation][astro-ui-frameworks]. This explains:

* 📦 how framework components are loaded,
* 💧 client-side hydration options, and
* 🤝 opportunities to mix and nest frameworks together

Writing and importing a Lit component in Astro looks like this:

```js title="src/components/my-element.js"
import { LitElement, html } from 'lit';

export class MyElement extends LitElement {
  render() {
    return html`<p>Hello world! From my-element</p>`;
  }
}

customElements.define('my-element', MyElement);
```

Now, the component is ready to be imported via the Astro frontmatter:

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
---
import { MyElement } from '../components/my-element.js';
---

<MyElement />
```

:::note
Lit requires browser globals such as `HTMLElement` and `customElements` to be present. For this reason the Lit renderer shims the server with these globals so Lit can run. You *might* run into libraries that work incorrectly because of this.
:::

### Experimental Decorators

To use [experimental decorators in Lit](https://lit.dev/docs/components/decorators/), add the following to your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json title="tsconfig.json" add={3}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
  }
}
```

This allows you to use experimental decorators such as `@customElement` and `@state` to register a custom element and define a state property in your Lit component:

```ts title="src/components/my-element.ts"
import { LitElement, html } from "lit";
import { customElement, state } from "lit/decorators.js";

@customElement("my-element")
export class MyElement extends LitElement {
    @state() name = "my-element";

    override render() {
        return html`<p>Hello world! From ${this.name}</p>`;
    }
}
```

### Polyfills & Hydration

The renderer automatically handles adding appropriate polyfills for support in browsers that don't have Declarative Shadow DOM. The polyfill is about *1.5kB*. If the browser does support Declarative Shadow DOM then less than 250 bytes are loaded (to feature detect support).

Hydration is also handled automatically. You can use the same hydration directives such as `client:load`, `client:idle` and `client:visible` as you can with other libraries that Astro supports.

```astro
---
import { MyElement } from '../components/my-element.js';
---

<MyElement client:visible />
```

The above will only load the element's JavaScript when the user has scrolled it into view. Since it is server rendered they will not see any jank; it will load and hydrate transparently.

## Troubleshooting

For help, check out the `#support` channel on [Discord](https://astro.build/chat). Our friendly Support Squad members are here to help!

You can also check our [Astro Integration Documentation][astro-integration] for more on integrations.

Common issues are listed below:

### Browser globals

The Lit integration's SSR works by adding a few browser global properties to the global environment. Some of the properties it adds includes `window`, `document`, and `location`.

These globals *can* interfere with other libraries that might use the existence of these variables to detect that they are running in the browser, when they are actually running in the server. This can cause bugs with these libraries.

Because of this, the Lit integration might not be compatible with these types of libraries. One thing that can help is changing the order of integrations when Lit is interfering with other integrations:

```js lang="js" title="astro.config.mjs" ins={7} del={6}
  import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
  import vue from '@astrojs/vue';
  import lit from '@astrojs/lit';

  export default defineConfig({
    integrations: [vue(), lit()]
    integrations: [lit(), vue()]
  });
```

The correct order might be different depending on the underlying cause of the problem. This is not guaranteed to fix every issue however, and some libraries cannot be used if you are using the Lit integration because of this.

### Strict package managers

When using a [strict package manager](https://pnpm.io/pnpm-vs-npm#npms-flat-tree) like `pnpm`, you may get an error such as `ReferenceError: module is not defined` when running your site. To fix this, hoist Lit dependencies with an `.npmrc` file:

```ini title=".npmrc"
public-hoist-pattern[]=*lit*
```

### Limitations

- The Lit integration is powered by `@lit-labs/ssr` which has some limitations. See their [limitations documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-labs/ssr#notes-and-limitations) to learn more.

- Astro does not support IntelliSense for Lit components.
