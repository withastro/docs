Railway is a cloud platform that makes it easy to deploy Astro applications with zero configuration. Deploy your Astro site to Railway using the one-click Astro template.

<ReadMore>Learn more about [Railway's platform](https://railway.com/?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=astro) and the [Astro template](https://railway.com/deploy/astro-starter?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=astro).</ReadMore>

## Deploy Astro to Railway

1. **Visit the Railway Astro template**
   
   Go to [railway.com/deploy/astro-starter](https://railway.com/deploy/astro-starter?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=astro) in your browser.

2. **Connect your GitHub account to Railway**
   
   Click "Deploy Now" and sign in with your GitHub account to authorize Railway. This will deploy the Astro template into your new Railway account.

3. **Customize your Astro Repo**

  Once the template is deployed, eject the service code into your own Github repository by following [this guide](https://docs.railway.com/guides/deploy#eject-from-template-repository?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=astro).

  This will allow you to keep the repo deployed but customize it with your own code.

  Your Astro site will be live and accessible via a Railway-provided URL within minutes.

## Deploy from an Existing Astro Project

If you already have an Astro project you'd like to deploy to Railway, follow the steps in [this guide](https://docs.railway.com/guides/astro?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=astro) to deploy it to Railway.

## Next Steps

Once your Astro site is deployed on Railway:

- **Monitor your deployment** - Use Railway's dashboard to monitor your site's performance and logs
- **Set up custom domains** - Add your own domain
- **Configure CI/CD** - Railway automatically deploys on every push to your main branch
- **Scale as needed** - Railway automatically handles horizontal and vertical scaling based on your traffic
