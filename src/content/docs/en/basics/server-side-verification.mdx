title: Server-side verification
i18nReady: true
---

By adding the client side code, you were able to render a Procaptcha widget that identified if users were real people or
automated bots. When the captcha succeeded, the Procaptcha script inserted unique data into your form data, which is
then sent to your server for verification. The are currently two options for verifying the user's response server side:

## API Verification

To verify that the token is indeed real and valid, you must now verify it at the API endpoint:

https://api.prosopo.io/siteverify

The endpoint expects a POST request with the `procaptcha-response` token. You must also pass your **secret key**, which you can obtain by [logging in to our customer portal](https://portal.prosopo.io).

A simple test will look like this, where the contents in data is the `procaptcha-response` token, after being
parsed:

```javascript
// pseudocode
// get the contents of the procaptcha-response token
data = req.body['procaptcha-response']

// send a POST application/json request to the API endpoint
response = POST('https://api.prosopo.io/siteverify', {
    token: data.token,
    secret: 'your_secret_key',
})
```

Or, as a CURL command:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.prosopo.io/siteverify' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{"secret":"your secret key copied from within the customer portal","token":"PROCAPTCHA-RESPONSE"}''
```

Note that the endpoint expects the application/json Content-Type. You can see exactly what is sent
using

```bash
curl -vv
```

in the example above.

## Verification Package

So far, we only have a TypeScript implementation of the Procaptcha verification package. However, we are working on
delivering additional language support in the future.

### TypeScript Verification

To verify a user's response using TypeScript, simpy import the `verify` function from `@prosopo/server` and pass it
the `procaptcha-response` POST data. Types can be imported from `@prosopo/types`.

```typescript
import {ProsopoServer} from '@prosopo/server'
import {ApiParams} from '@prosopo/types'

...
// parse the body received from the frontend
const payload = JSON.parse(event.body)

// parse the procaptcha response token
const procaptchaResponse = payload[ApiParams.procaptchaResponse]

// initialise the `ProsopoServer` class
const prosopoServer = new ProsopoServer(config)

// check if the captcha response is verified
if (await prosopoServer.isVerified(procaptchaResponse)) {
    // perform CAPTCHA protected action
}
```

There is an example TypeScript server side implementation
in [demos/client-example-server](/en/demos/client-example-server/).
