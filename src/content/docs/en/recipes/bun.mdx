[Bun](https://bun.sh/) is an all-in-one JavaScript runtime & toolkit. See [Bun's documentation](https://bun.sh/docs) for more information.

:::caution
Using Bun with Astro may reveal rough edges. Some integrations may not work as expected. Consult [Bun's official documentation for working with Astro](https://bun.sh/guides/ecosystem/astro) for details.

If you have any problems using Bun, please [open an Issue on GitHub with Bun directly](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/new/choose).
:::

## Prerequisites

- Bun installed locally on your machine. See the [installation instructions](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) in Bun's official documentation.

## Create a new Astro project with Bun

Create a new Astro project with Bun using the following `create-astro` command:

```bash
bun create astro my-astro-project-using-bun
```

:::tip
You may also [create a new Astro project from any existing Astro GitHub repository](/en/install-and-setup/#install-from-the-cli-wizard) using the `--template` flag:
```bash
bun create astro my-astro-project-using-bun --template eliancodes/brutal
```
:::

## Install dependencies

If you skipped the “Install dependencies?” step during the CLI wizard, then be sure to install your dependencies before continuing.

```bash
bun install
```

## Add Types

Bun publishes the [`@types/bun`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/bun) package, containing the runtime types for Bun.

Install `@types/bun` using the following command:

```sh
bun add -d @types/bun
```

## Using Astro integrations

You can also use any of the official Astro integrations with the `astro add` command:

```bash
bun astro add react
```

## Develop and build

To run the development server, use following command:

```bash
bun run dev
```

### Build and preview your site

To build your site, use the following command:

```bash
bun run build
```

When the build is finished, run the appropriate preview command (e.g. bun run preview) in your terminal and you can view the built version of your site locally in the same browser preview window.

## Testing

Bun ships with a fast, built-in, Jest-compatible test runner through the `bun test` command. If you like to use that read [`bun test` documentation](https://bun.sh/docs/cli/test).

Otherwise, you can view other supported tools for testing [here](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/testing/).
