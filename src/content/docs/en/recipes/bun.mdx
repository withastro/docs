[Bun](https://bun.sh/) is a runtime for JavaScript built for speed. See [Bun's documentation](https://bun.sh/docs) for more information.

Using Bun with Astro still is experimental. Some integrations may not work as expected. If you have [any problems using Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/new/choose), please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/new/choose)!

## Installing Bun

Use the following command to install Bun:


```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

## Create a new Astro project with Bun

Create a new Astro project with Bun using the following `create astro` command:

```bash
bunx create-astro@latest my-astro-project-using-bun
```

:::tip[Tip]
You can also [create a new Astro project from any existing Astro GitHub repository](/en/install/auto/#starter-templates) using the `--template` flag:
```bash
bunx create-astro@latest my-astro-project-using-bun --template eliancodes/brutal
```
:::

## Install your dependencies

If you're starting a new project using `bunx create-astro`, the CLI will automatically use Bun to install dependencies and you can skip this step. 

Otherwise, you'll need to install your dependencies with Bun:

```bash
bun install
```

## Running the development server

To run the development server, use the following command:

```bash
bun run dev
```

:::note[Note]
Use the full command `bun run dev` to start your Astro development server. The command `bun dev` will start Bun's own internal dev server.
:::

## Using Astro integrations

You can also use any of the official Astro integrations with Bun and the `astro add` command:

```bash
bunx astro add react
```

This will work exactly the same as if you were using NPM, but with the added benefit of using Bun's blazing fast runtime.

:::note[Note]
Some integrations might not work as expected. If you find any issues, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/new/choose)!

## Building your site with Bun

To build and serve your site, Bun has familiar commands:

```bash
bun run build
```

Bun's build command will output your site to the `dist/` directory.

Then, you can serve your site using the `preview` command:

```bash
bun preview
```
