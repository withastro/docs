<DontEditWarning />

The following reference covers all supported configuration options in Astro. To learn more about configuring Astro, read our guide on [Configuring Astro](/en/guides/configuring-astro/).

```js
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'

export default defineConfig({
  // your configuration options here...
})
```
## Top-Level Options

### root

<p>

**Type:** `string`<br />
**CLI:** `--root`<br />
**Default:** `"."` (current working directory)
</p>

You should only provide this option if you run the `astro` CLI commands in a directory other than the project root directory. Usually, this option is provided via the CLI instead of the [Astro config file](/en/guides/configuring-astro/#supported-config-file-types), since Astro needs to know your project root before it can locate your config file.

If you provide a relative path (ex: `--root: './my-project'`) Astro will resolve it against your current working directory.

#### Examples

```js
{
  root: './my-project-directory'
}
```
```bash
$ astro build --root ./my-project-directory
```


### srcDir

<p>

**Type:** `string`<br />
**Default:** `"./src"`
</p>

Set the directory that Astro will read your site from.

The value can be either an absolute file system path or a path relative to the project root.

```js
{
  srcDir: './www'
}
```


### publicDir

<p>

**Type:** `string`<br />
**Default:** `"./public"`
</p>

Set the directory for your static assets. Files in this directory are served at `/` during dev and copied to your build directory during build. These files are always served or copied as-is, without transform or bundling.

The value can be either an absolute file system path or a path relative to the project root.

```js
{
  publicDir: './my-custom-publicDir-directory'
}
```


### outDir

<p>

**Type:** `string`<br />
**Default:** `"./dist"`
</p>

Set the directory that `astro build` writes your final build to.

The value can be either an absolute file system path or a path relative to the project root.

```js
{
  outDir: './my-custom-build-directory'
}
```
**See Also:**
- build.server


### cacheDir

<p>

**Type:** `string`<br />
**Default:** `"./node_modules/.astro"`
</p>

Set the directory for caching build artifacts. Files in this directory will be used in subsequent builds to speed up the build time.

The value can be either an absolute file system path or a path relative to the project root.

```js
{
  cacheDir: './my-custom-cache-directory'
}
```


### redirects

<p>

**Type:** `Record.<string, RedirectConfig>`<br />
**Default:** `{}`<br />
<Since v="2.9.0" />
</p>

Specify a mapping of redirects where the key is the route to match
and the value is the path to redirect to.

You can redirect both static and dynamic routes, but only to the same kind of route.
For example you cannot have a `'/article': '/blog/[...slug]'` redirect.


```js
{
  redirects: {
    '/old': '/new',
    '/blog/[...slug]': '/articles/[...slug]',
  }
}
```


For statically-generated sites with no adapter installed, this will produce a client redirect using a [`<meta http-equiv="refresh">` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta#http-equiv) and does not support status codes.

When using SSR or with a static adapter in `output: static`
mode, status codes are supported.
Astro will serve redirected GET requests with a status of `301`
and use a status of `308` for any other request method.

You can customize the [redirection status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#redirection_messages) using an object in the redirect config:

```js
{
  redirects: {
    '/other': {
      status: 302,
      destination: '/place',
    },
  }
}
```


### site

<p>

**Type:** `string`
</p>

Your final, deployed URL. Astro uses this full URL to generate your sitemap and canonical URLs in your final build. It is strongly recommended that you set this configuration to get the most out of Astro.

```js
{
  site: 'https://www.my-site.dev'
}
```


### compressHTML

<p>

**Type:** `boolean`<br />
**Default:** `true`
</p>

This is an option to minify your HTML output and reduce the size of your HTML files. By default, Astro removes all whitespace from your HTML, including line breaks, from `.astro` components. This occurs both in development mode and in the final build.
To disable HTML compression, set the `compressHTML` flag to `false`.

```js
{
  compressHTML: false
}
```


### base

<p>

**Type:** `string`
</p>

The base path to deploy to. Astro will use this path as the root for your pages and assets both in development and in production build.

In the example below, `astro dev` will start your server at `/docs`.

```js
{
  base: '/docs'
}
```

When using this option, all of your static asset imports and URLs should add the base as a prefix. You can access this value via `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`.

The value of `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` respects your `trailingSlash` config and will include a trailing slash if you explicitly include one or if `trailingSlash: "always"` is set. If `trailingSlash: "never"` is set, `BASE_URL` will not include a trailing slash, even if `base` includes one.


### trailingSlash

<p>

**Type:** `'always' | 'never' | 'ignore'`<br />
**Default:** `'ignore'`
</p>

Set the route matching behavior of the dev server. Choose from the following options:
  - `'always'` - Only match URLs that include a trailing slash (ex: "/foo/")
  - `'never'` - Never match URLs that include a trailing slash (ex: "/foo")
  - `'ignore'` - Match URLs regardless of whether a trailing "/" exists

Use this configuration option if your production host has strict handling of how trailing slashes work or do not work.

You can also set this if you prefer to be more strict yourself, so that URLs with or without trailing slashes won't work during development.

```js
{
  // Example: Require a trailing slash during development
  trailingSlash: 'always'
}
```
**See Also:**
- build.format


### scopedStyleStrategy

<p>

**Type:** `'where' | 'class' | 'attribute'`<br />
**Default:** `'attribute'`<br />
<Since v="2.4" />
</p>

Specify the strategy used for scoping styles within Astro components. Choose from:
  - `'where'` 		- Use `:where` selectors, causing no specificity increase.
  - `'class'` 		- Use class-based selectors, causing a +1 specificity increase.
  - `'attribute'` 	- Use `data-` attributes, causing a +1 specificity increase.

Using `'class'` is helpful when you want to ensure that element selectors within an Astro component override global style defaults (e.g. from a global stylesheet).
Using `'where'` gives you more control over specificity, but requires that you use higher-specificity selectors, layers, and other tools to control which selectors are applied.
Using `'attribute'` is useful when you are manipulating the `class` attribute of elements and need to avoid conflicts between your own styling logic and Astro's application of styles.


### adapter

<p>

**Type:** `AstroIntegration`
</p>

Deploy to your favorite server, serverless, or edge host with build adapters. Import one of our first-party adapters for [Netlify](/en/guides/deploy/netlify/#adapter-for-ssr), [Vercel](/en/guides/deploy/vercel/#adapter-for-ssr), and more to engage Astro SSR.

[See our Server-side Rendering guide](/en/guides/server-side-rendering/) for more on SSR, and [our deployment guides](/en/guides/deploy/) for a complete list of hosts.

```js
import netlify from '@astrojs/netlify/functions';
{
  // Example: Build for Netlify serverless deployment
  adapter: netlify(),
}
```
**See Also:**
- output


### output

<p>

**Type:** `'static' | 'server' | 'hybrid'`<br />
**Default:** `'static'`
</p>

Specifies the output target for builds.

- `'static'` - Building a static site to be deploy to any static host.
- `'server'` - Building an app to be deployed to a host supporting SSR (server-side rendering).
- `'hybrid'` - Building a static site with a few server-side rendered pages.

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  output: 'static'
})
```
**See Also:**
- adapter


## Build Options

### build.format

<p>

**Type:** `('file' | 'directory')`<br />
**Default:** `'directory'`
</p>

Control the output file format of each page.
  - If `'file'`, Astro will generate an HTML file (ex: "/foo.html") for each page.
  - If `'directory'`, Astro will generate a directory with a nested `index.html` file (ex: "/foo/index.html") for each page.

```js
{
  build: {
    // Example: Generate `page.html` instead of `page/index.html` during build.
    format: 'file'
  }
}
```

#### Effect on Astro.url
Setting `build.format` controls what `Astro.url` is set to during the build. When it is:
- `directory` - The `Astro.url.pathname` will include a trailing slash to mimic folder behavior; ie `/foo/`.
- `file` - The `Astro.url.pathname` will include `.html`; ie `/foo.html`.

This means that when you create relative URLs using `new URL('./relative', Astro.url)`, you will get consistent behavior between dev and build.

To prevent inconsistencies with trailing slash behaviour in dev, you can restrict the [`trailingSlash` option](#trailingslash) to `'always'` or `'never'` depending on your build format:
- `directory` - Set `trailingSlash: 'always'`
- `file` - Set `trailingSlash: 'never'`


### build.client

<p>

**Type:** `string`<br />
**Default:** `'./dist/client'`
</p>

Controls the output directory of your client-side CSS and JavaScript when `output: 'server'` or `output: 'hybrid'` only.
`outDir` controls where the code is built to.

This value is relative to the `outDir`.

```js
{
  output: 'server', // or 'hybrid'
  build: {
    client: './client'
  }
}
```


### build.server

<p>

**Type:** `string`<br />
**Default:** `'./dist/server'`
</p>

Controls the output directory of server JavaScript when building to SSR.

This value is relative to the `outDir`.

```js
{
  build: {
    server: './server'
  }
}
```


### build.assets

<p>

**Type:** `string`<br />
**Default:** `'_astro'`<br />
<Since v="2.0.0" />
</p>

Specifies the directory in the build output where Astro-generated assets (bundled JS and CSS for example) should live.

```js
{
  build: {
    assets: '_custom'
  }
}
```
**See Also:**
- outDir


### build.assetsPrefix

<p>

**Type:** `string`<br />
**Default:** `undefined`<br />
<Since v="2.2.0" />
</p>

Specifies the prefix for Astro-generated asset links. This can be used if assets are served from a different domain than the current site.

For example, if this is set to `https://cdn.example.com`, assets will be fetched from `https://cdn.example.com/_astro/...` (regardless of the `base` option).
You would need to upload the files in `./dist/_astro/` to `https://cdn.example.com/_astro/` to serve the assets.
The process varies depending on how the third-party domain is hosted.
To rename the `_astro` path, specify a new directory in `build.assets`.

```js
{
  build: {
    assetsPrefix: 'https://cdn.example.com'
  }
}
```


### build.serverEntry

<p>

**Type:** `string`<br />
**Default:** `'entry.mjs'`
</p>

Specifies the file name of the server entrypoint when building to SSR.
This entrypoint is usually dependent on which host you are deploying to and
will be set by your adapter for you.

Note that it is recommended that this file ends with `.mjs` so that the runtime
detects that the file is a JavaScript module.

```js
{
  build: {
    serverEntry: 'main.mjs'
  }
}
```


### build.redirects

<p>

**Type:** `boolean`<br />
**Default:** `true`<br />
<Since v="2.6.0" />
</p>

Specifies whether redirects will be output to HTML during the build.
This option only applies to `output: 'static'` mode; in SSR redirects
are treated the same as all responses.

This option is mostly meant to be used by adapters that have special
configuration files for redirects and do not need/want HTML based redirects.

```js
{
  build: {
    redirects: false
  }
}
```


### build.inlineStylesheets

<p>

**Type:** `'always' | 'auto' | 'never'`<br />
**Default:** `auto`<br />
<Since v="2.6.0" />
</p>

Control whether project styles are sent to the browser in a separate css file or inlined into `<style>` tags. Choose from the following options:
 - `'always'` - project styles are inlined into `<style>` tags
 - `'auto'` - only stylesheets smaller than `ViteConfig.build.assetsInlineLimit` (default: 4kb) are inlined. Otherwise, project styles are sent in external stylesheets.
 - `'never'` - project styles are sent in external stylesheets

```js
{
	build: {
		inlineStylesheets: `never`,
	},
}
```


### build.split


:::caution[Deprecated]
Deprecated since version 3.0.
:::

<p>

**Type:** `boolean`<br />
**Default:** `false`
</p>

The build config option `build.split` has been replaced by the adapter configuration option [`functionPerRoute`](/en/reference/adapter-reference/#functionperroute).

Please see your [SSR adapter's documentation](/en/guides/integrations-guide/#official-integrations) for using `functionPerRoute` to define how your SSR code is bundled.


### build.excludeMiddleware


:::caution[Deprecated]
Deprecated since version 3.0.
:::

<p>

**Type:** `boolean`<br />
**Default:** `false`
</p>

The build config option `build.excludeMiddleware` has been replaced by the adapter configuration option [`edgeMiddleware`](/en/reference/adapter-reference/#edgemiddleware).

Please see your [SSR adapter's documentation](/en/guides/integrations-guide/#official-integrations) for using `edgeMiddleware` to define whether or not any SSR middleware code will be bundled when built.


## Server Options

Customize the Astro dev server, used by both `astro dev` and `astro preview`.

```js
{
  server: { port: 1234, host: true}
}
```

To set different configuration based on the command run ("dev", "preview") a function can also be passed to this configuration option.

```js
{
  // Example: Use the function syntax to customize based on command
  server: ({ command }) => ({ port: command === 'dev' ? 4321 : 4000 })
}
```

### server.host

<p>

**Type:** `string | boolean`<br />
**Default:** `false`<br />
<Since v="0.24.0" />
</p>

Set which network IP addresses the server should listen on (i.e. non-localhost IPs).
- `false` - do not expose on a network IP address
- `true` - listen on all addresses, including LAN and public addresses
- `[custom-address]` - expose on a network IP address at `[custom-address]` (ex: `192.168.0.1`)


### server.port

<p>

**Type:** `number`<br />
**Default:** `4321`
</p>

Set which port the server should listen on.

If the given port is already in use, Astro will automatically try the next available port.

```js
{
  server: { port: 8080 }
}
```


### server.headers

<p>

**Type:** `OutgoingHttpHeaders`<br />
**Default:** `{}`<br />
<Since v="1.7.0" />
</p>

Set custom HTTP response headers to be sent in `astro dev` and `astro preview`.


## Image Options

### image.endpoint

<p>

**Type:** `string`<br />
**Default:** `undefined`<br />
<Since v="3.1.0" />
</p>

Set the endpoint to use for image optimization in dev and SSR. Set to `undefined` to use the default endpoint.

The endpoint will always be injected at `/_image`.

```js
{
  image: {
    // Example: Use a custom image endpoint
    endpoint: './src/image-endpoint.ts',
  },
}
```


### image.service

<p>

**Type:** `Object`<br />
**Default:** `{entrypoint: 'astro/assets/services/sharp', config?: {}}`<br />
<Since v="2.1.0" />
</p>

Set which image service is used for Astro’s assets support.

The value should be an object with an entrypoint for the image service to use and optionally, a config object to pass to the service.

The service entrypoint can be either one of the included services, or a third-party package.

```js
{
  image: {
    // Example: Enable the Sharp-based image service
    service: { entrypoint: 'astro/assets/services/sharp' },
  },
}
```


### image.domains

<p>

**Type:** `Array.<string>`<br />
**Default:** `{domains: []}`<br />
<Since v="2.10.10" />
</p>

Defines a list of permitted image source domains for remote image optimization. No other remote images will be optimized by Astro.

This option requires an array of individual domain names as strings. Wildcards are not permitted. Instead, use [`image.remotePatterns`](#imageremotepatterns) to define a list of allowed source URL patterns.

```js
// astro.config.mjs
{
  image: {
    // Example: Allow remote image optimization from a single domain
    domains: ['astro.build'],
  },
}
```


### image.remotePatterns

<p>

**Type:** `Array.<RemotePattern>`<br />
**Default:** `{remotePatterns: []}`<br />
<Since v="2.10.10" />
</p>

Defines a list of permitted image source URL patterns for remote image optimization.

`remotePatterns` can be configured with four properties:
1. protocol
2. hostname
3. port
4. pathname

```js
{
  image: {
    // Example: allow processing all images from your aws s3 bucket
    remotePatterns: [{
      protocol: 'https',
      hostname: '**.amazonaws.com',
    }],
  },
}
```

You can use wildcards to define the permitted `hostname` and `pathname` values as described below. Otherwise, only the exact values provided will be configured:
`hostname`:
  - Start with '**.' to allow all subdomains ('endsWith').
  - Start with '*.' to allow only one level of subdomain.

`pathname`:
  - End with '/**' to allow all sub-routes ('startsWith').
  - End with '/*' to allow only one level of sub-route.


## Markdown Options

### markdown.drafts


:::caution[Deprecated]
Deprecated since version 3.0. Use content collections instead.
:::

<p>

**Type:** `boolean`<br />
**Default:** `false`
</p>

Control whether Markdown draft pages should be included in the build.

A Markdown page is considered a draft if it includes `draft: true` in its frontmatter. Draft pages are always included & visible during development (`astro dev`) but by default they will not be included in your final build.

```js
{
  markdown: {
    // Example: Include all drafts in your final build
    drafts: true,
  }
}
```


### markdown.shikiConfig

<p>

**Type:** `Partial<ShikiConfig>`
</p>

Shiki configuration options. See [the Markdown configuration docs](/en/guides/markdown-content/#shiki-configuration) for usage.


### markdown.syntaxHighlight

<p>

**Type:** `'shiki' | 'prism' | false`<br />
**Default:** `shiki`
</p>

Which syntax highlighter to use, if any.
- `shiki` - use the [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) highlighter
- `prism` - use the [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) highlighter
- `false` - do not apply syntax highlighting.

```js
{
  markdown: {
    // Example: Switch to use prism for syntax highlighting in Markdown
    syntaxHighlight: 'prism',
  }
}
```


### markdown.remarkPlugins

<p>

**Type:** `RemarkPlugins`
</p>

Pass [remark plugins](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) to customize how your Markdown is built. You can import and apply the plugin function (recommended), or pass the plugin name as a string.

```js
import remarkToc from 'remark-toc';
{
  markdown: {
    remarkPlugins: [remarkToc]
  }
}
```


### markdown.rehypePlugins

<p>

**Type:** `RehypePlugins`
</p>

Pass [rehype plugins](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-rehype) to customize how your Markdown's output HTML is processed. You can import and apply the plugin function (recommended), or pass the plugin name as a string.

```js
import { rehypeAccessibleEmojis } from 'rehype-accessible-emojis';
{
  markdown: {
    rehypePlugins: [rehypeAccessibleEmojis]
  }
}
```


### markdown.gfm

<p>

**Type:** `boolean`<br />
**Default:** `true`<br />
<Since v="2.0.0" />
</p>

Astro uses [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm) by default. To disable this, set the `gfm` flag to `false`:

```js
{
  markdown: {
    gfm: false,
  }
}
```


### markdown.smartypants

<p>

**Type:** `boolean`<br />
**Default:** `true`<br />
<Since v="2.0.0" />
</p>

Astro uses the [SmartyPants formatter](https://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/) by default. To disable this, set the `smartypants` flag to `false`:

```js
{
  markdown: {
    smartypants: false,
  }
}
```


### markdown.remarkRehype

<p>

**Type:** `RemarkRehype`
</p>

Pass options to [remark-rehype](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-rehype#api).

```js
{
  markdown: {
    // Example: Translate the footnotes text to another language, here are the default English values
    remarkRehype: { footnoteLabel: "Footnotes", footnoteBackLabel: "Back to content"},
  },
};
```


## Integrations

Extend Astro with custom integrations. Integrations are your one-stop-shop for adding framework support (like Solid.js), new features (like sitemaps), and new libraries (like Partytown).

Read our [Integrations Guide](/en/guides/integrations-guide/) for help getting started with Astro Integrations.

```js
import react from '@astrojs/react';
import tailwind from '@astrojs/tailwind';
{
  // Example: Add React + Tailwind support to Astro
  integrations: [react(), tailwind()]
}
```

## Vite

Pass additional configuration options to Vite. Useful when Astro doesn't support some advanced configuration that you may need.

View the full `vite` configuration object documentation on [vitejs.dev](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

#### Examples

```js
{
  vite: {
    ssr: {
      // Example: Force a broken package to skip SSR processing, if needed
      external: ['broken-npm-package'],
    }
  }
}
```

```js
{
  vite: {
    // Example: Add custom vite plugins directly to your Astro project
    plugins: [myPlugin()],
  }
}
```

## Legacy Flags

To help some users migrate between versions of Astro, we occasionally introduce `legacy` flags.
These flags allow you to opt in to some deprecated or otherwise outdated behavior of Astro
in the latest version, so that you can continue to upgrade and take advantage of new Astro releases.

## Experimental Flags

Astro offers experimental flags to give users early access to new features.
These flags are not guaranteed to be stable.

### experimental.optimizeHoistedScript

<p>

**Type:** `boolean`<br />
**Default:** `false`<br />
<Since v="2.10.4" />
</p>

Prevents unused components' scripts from being included in a page unexpectedly.
The optimization is best-effort and may inversely miss including the used scripts. Make sure to double-check your built pages
before publishing.
Enable hoisted script analysis optimization by adding the experimental flag:

```js
{
	experimental: {
		optimizeHoistedScript: true,
	},
}
```
