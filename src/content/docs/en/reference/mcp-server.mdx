import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The experimental Astro Docs MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides AI tools with access to the latest Astro documentation. This allows them to retrieve accurate, up-to-date information about Astro's features, APIs, and best practices, enhancing their ability to assist with Astro development tasks.

:::tip[What is MCP?]
[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) is a standardized way for AI tools to access external tools and data sources.
:::

The Astro Docs MCP server is a free and [open-source](https://github.com/withastro/docs-mcp/issues) service which doesn't require you to install anything locally. It uses the [Kapa](https://www.kapa.ai/) API, which maintains an up-to-date index of the Astro documentation and also powers the AI support bot in the [Astro Discord](https://astro.build/chat).

## Server Details

- **Name**: Astro Docs
- **URL**: `https://mcp.docs.astro.build/mcp`
- **Transport**: Streamable HTTP

This server uses streamable HTTP transport, which may not be compatible with all tools. Check your tool's documentation for MCP support.

## Installation

The setup process varies depending on your AI development tool. You may see some tools refer to MCP servers as connectors, adapters, extensions or plugins.

### Claude Code

[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) is an agentic coding tool that runs on the command line. Enabling the Astro Docs MCP server allows it to access the latest documentation while generating Astro code.

Install using the terminal command:

```shell
claude mcp add --transport http "Astro docs" https://mcp.docs.astro.build/mcp
```

### Windsurf

[Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/) is an AI-powered agentic coding tool, available as editor plugins or a standalone editor. It can use the Astro Docs MCP server to access documentation while performing coding tasks.

Windsurf doesn't support streaming HTTP, so requires a local proxy configuration:

<Steps>

1. Open `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` in your editor.
2. Add the following configuration to your Windsurf MCP settings:

   ```json title="MCP Configuration" {3-6}
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "Astro docs": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.docs.astro.build/mcp"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Save the configuration and restart Windsurf

</Steps>

### ChatGPT

:::caution[Limited availability]
MCP server integration is only available for ChatGPT Pro, Team, and Enterprise users. The setup process is more complex than other tools.
:::

Refer to the [OpenAI MCP documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/mcp#test-and-connect-your-mcp-server) for specific setup instructions.

## Usage

Once configured, you can ask your AI tool questions about Astro, and it will retrieve information directly from the latest docs. Coding agents will be able to consult the latest documentation when performing coding tasks, and chat bots will be able to accurately answer questions about Astro features, APIs, and best practices.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Verify your tool supports streamable HTTP transport
- Check that the server URL is correct: `https://mcp.docs.astro.build/mcp`
- Ensure your tool has proper internet access
- Consult your specific tool's MCP integration documentation
- If you are still having problems, open an issue in the [Astro Docs MCP Server repository](https://github.com/withastro/docs-mcp/issues)

:::note[Remember]
The Astro Docs MCP server just provides access to the documentation. Your AI tool is responsible for interpreting it, and for the actual code generation. AI makes mistakes, so always review generated code carefully.
