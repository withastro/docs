Enables experimental [Chrome DevTools workspace integration](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/workspaces) for the Astro dev server.

This feature allows you to edit files directly in Chrome DevTools and have those changes reflected in your local file system via a connected workspace folder. This is useful for applying edits such as adjusting CSS values without leaving your browser tab.

With this feature enabled, running `astro dev` will automatically configure a Chrome DevTools workspace for your project. Your project will then appear as an available [workspace source that you can connect](#connecting-your-project). Then, changes that you make in the "Sources" panel are automatically saved to your project source code.

To enable this feature, add the experimental flag `chromeDevtoolsWorkspace` to your Astro config:

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={4-6}
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  experimental: {
    chromeDevtoolsWorkspace: true,
  },
});
```

## Connecting your project

Astro will create the necessary configuration file to support Chrome DevTools workspaces. However, your project must also be [connected as a source](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/workspaces#manual-connection) to enable file saving.

<Steps>

1. [Start the Astro dev server](/en/develop-and-build/#start-the-astro-dev-server) with the appropriate CLI command for your package manager.

2. Navigate to your site preview (e.g. `http://localhost:4321/`) in Chrome and open DevTools.

3. Under the **Sources* > **Workspaces** tab, you will find your Astro project folder. Click **Connect** to add your directory as a workspace.

</Steps>

See the [Chrome DevTools workspace documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/workspaces#connect) for more information.
