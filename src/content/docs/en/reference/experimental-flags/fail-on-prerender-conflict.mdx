Turns prerender conflict warnings into errors during the build process.

Multiple dynamic routes can result in the same output path; for example, both `/blog/[slug]` and `/blog/[...all]` could try to prerender the `/blog/post-1` path. In such cases, Astro will warn you about the conflict during build and render only the [highest priority route](/en/guides/routing/#route-priority-order) for the conflicting path. With this flag set, the build will instead fail immediately with an error.

This will be the default behavior in Astro 6.

Enable it in your `astro.config.mjs`:

```js
// astro.config.mjs
defineConfig({
	experimental: {
		failOnPrerenderConflict: true,
	},
});
```
