Sessions are used to store user state between requests for [on-demand rendered pages](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/).

This experimental feature allows you to store and access items such as login status, shopping cart contents, or other user-specific data:

```astro title="src/components/CartButton.astro" {3}
---
export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode
const cart = await Astro.session.get('cart');
---

<a href="/checkout">ðŸ›’ {cart?.length ?? 0} items</a>
```

Sessions rely on a [configurable session `driver`](#enabling-experimental-sessions) to store data on the `session` object. A [session cookie](#cookies) stores an identifying session ID.

The [`session` object](#sessions-api) allows you to interact with the stored user state (e.g. add items to a shopping cart) and the session ID (e.g. delete the session ID cookie when logging out).

## Enabling experimental sessions

In this early release of `experimental.sessions`, Astro's official server adapters have not yet been updated to provide a default session driver based on the platform's default storage feature. Until these are built in, you will have to specify a `driver` yourself in the `experimental.sessions` configuration object in addition to [adding an adapter](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/#add-an-adapter).

The following sections show the recommended drivers for each adapter. (These will be automatically configured for you in the stable release of this feature.) Alternatively, you can specify [any supported driver from unstorage](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/). 

### Configuring sessions with the Node adapter

The Node adapter is compatible with the the [filesystem driver](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/fs). Note that this cannot be used in serverless environments as they have no shared filesystem.

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={6}
	{
    adapter: node({ mode: 'standalone' }),
		experimental: {
      session: {
        // Required: the name of the unstorage driver
        driver: "fs",
      },
    },
	}
```

### Configuring a session driver for other adapters

Choose the [unstorage `driver` name](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/) that corresponds to the storage feature provided by your hosting platform, such as the [Netlify Blobs driver (`netlify-blobs`)](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/netlify), the [Cloudflare KV driver (`cloudflare-kv-binding`)](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/cloudflare) or the [Deno KV driver (`deno-kv`)](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/deno). You can also use a cross-platform driver such as [Upstash](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/upstash) or [Redis](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/redis).

:::note
Some drivers may need extra packages to be installed. For example, the `netlify-blobs` driver requires the `@netlify/blobs` package, and Upstash requires the `@upstash/redis` package. Some drivers may also require environment variables or credentials to be set.

<ReadMore>See [the unstorage driver docs](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers) for more information.</ReadMore>
:::

### Driver options

You can also pass any available options to the unstorage driver in a separate `session.options` object. The following example configures the [Netlify Blobs](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/netlify) driver while also providing a `name` and specifying a `consistency` mode:

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={7-11}
  {
    adapter: netlify(),
    experimental: {
      session: {
        // The name of the unstorage driver is kebab-case
        driver: "netlify-blobs",
        options: {
          name: 'astro-sessions',
          // Sessions need strong consistency
          consistency: 'strong',
        }
      },
    },
  }
```

## Using sessions

Once you have configured a driver, you can use the `session` object to interact with the session. This object is accessible as `Astro.session` in your Astro components and pages and on the `context` object in API endpoints, middleware and actions. The API is the same in all cases.

In most cases you will only need to use [`Astro.session.get()`](#sessionget) and [`Astro.session.set()`](#sessionset). For other available methods, see the [API section](#sessions-api).

### Astro components and pages

In `.astro` components and pages, you can access the session object via the global `Astro` object. For example, to display the number of items in a shopping cart:

```astro title="src/components/CartButton.astro" "Astro.session"
---
export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode
const cart = await Astro.session.get('cart');
---

<a href="/checkout">ðŸ›’ {cart?.length ?? 0} items</a>
```

### API endpoints

In API endpoints, the session object is available on the `context` object. For example, to add an item to a shopping cart:

```ts title="src/pages/api/addToCart.ts" "context.session"
import type { APIContext } from "astro";

export async function POST(req: Request, context: APIContext) {
  const cart = await context.session.get("cart");
  cart.push(req.body.item);
  await context.session.set("cart", cart);
  return Response.json(cart);
}
```

### Actions

In actions, the session object is available on the `context` object. For example, to add an item to a shopping cart:

```ts title="src/actions/addToCart.ts" "context.session"
import { defineAction } from "astro:actions";
import { z } from "astro:schema";

export const server = {
  addToCart: defineAction({
    input: z.object({ productId: z.string() }),
    handler: async (input, context) => {
      const cart = await context.session.get("cart");
      cart.push(input.productId);
      await context.session.set("cart", cart);
      return cart;
    },
  }),
};
```

### Middleware

:::note
Sessions are not currently supported in edge middleware.
:::

In middleware, the session object is available on the `context` object. For example, to set the last visit time in the session:

```ts title="src/middleware.ts" "context.session"
import { defineMiddleware } from 'astro:middleware';

export const onRequest = defineMiddleware(async (context, next) => {
  context.session.set('lastVisit', new Date());
  return next();
});
```

## Cookies

Sessions are generated when first accessed, and a session ID cookie is set in the response. No actual user data is stored in the cookie â€“ just an ID that is used to identify a user's session. The session can be regenerated at any time with [`Astro.session.regenerate()`](#sessionregenerate), and destroyed with [`Astro.session.destroy()`](#sessiondestroy).

### `session.cookie`

<p>

**Type:** `string` | `object`<br />
**Default:** `undefined`<br />

</p>

An optional property to set cookie options. The `cookie.name` property can be automatically set by providing a string. To configure additional options, provide an object.

```js title="astro.config.mjs" {5} ins={7-10}
  {
    experimental: {
      session: {
        // If set to a string, this will be used as the cookie name
        // cookie: "my-session-id",
        // If set to an object, this will allow advanced options to be set
        cookie: {
          name: "my-session-id"
          sameSite: "Strict",
        },
      }
    }
  }
```

## Sessions API

The session object is available in all Astro contexts, including components, actions, and API endpoints. In components, it is accessed via the global `Astro` object, and in actions and API endpoints it is available on the `context` object. The API is the same in all cases.

Values are serialized and deserialized using [devalue](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/devalue), which is the same library used by content layer and actions. This means that supported types are the same, and include strings, numbers, `Date`, `Map`, `Set`, `URL`, arrays and plain objects.


### `session.get()` 

<p>

**Type**: `(key: string) => Promise<any>`
</p>

Returns the value of the given key in the session. If the key does not exist, it returns `undefined`.

### `session.set()`

<p>

**Type**: `(key: string, value: any, options?: { ttl: number }) => void`
</p>

Sets the value of the given key in the session. The value can be any serializable type.

### `session.regenerate()`

<p>

**Type**: `() => void`
</p>

Regenerates the session ID. Best practice is to call this when a user logs in or escalates their privileges, to prevent session fixation attacks.

### `session.destroy()`

<p>

**Type**: `() => void`
</p>

Destroys the session, deleting the cookie and the object from the backend. This should be called when a user logs out or their session is otherwise invalidated.
