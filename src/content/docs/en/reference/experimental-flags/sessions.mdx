Sessions are used to store user state between requests for [on-demand rendered pages](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/).

This experimental feature allows you to store and access items such as login status, shopping cart contents, or other user-specific data:

```astro title="src/components/CartButton.astro" {3}
---
export const prerender = false; // Not needed with 'server' output
const cart = await Astro.session.get('cart');
---

<a href="/checkout">ðŸ›’ {cart?.length ?? 0} items</a>
```

Sessions rely on a [configurable session `driver`](#enabling-experimental-sessions) to store data on the `session` object. A [session cookie](#sessioncookie) stores an identifying session ID.

The [`session` object](#sessions-api) allows you to interact with the stored user state (e.g. add items to a shopping cart) and the session ID (e.g. delete the session ID cookie when logging out).

## Enabling experimental sessions

To enable sessions, set the `experimental.session` flag to `true`. Sessions only work on pages with on-demand rendering, so you need to [install an adapter](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/#add-an-adapter) that supports on-demand rendering, and ensure that any pages that use sessions are set to `prerender: false`, or `output` is set to `server` in the Astro config.

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={6}
  {
    adapter: node({
      mode: "standalone",
    }),
    experimental: {
      session: true,
    },
  }
```

Sessions require a storage driver to store the session data. The Node and Netlify adapters automatically configure a default driver for you, but other adapters currently require you to [specify a driver manually](#configuring-a-session-driver). You can use [any supported driver from unstorage](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/).

### Configuring a session driver

If you are using an adapter that doesn't have a default driver, or if you want to choose a different driver, you can configure it using the `session` configuration option:

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={4}
  {
    adapter: vercel(),
    session: {
      driver: "upstash",
    },
    experimental: {
      session: true,
    },
  }
```

Configure `session.driver` with the unstorage `driver` name that corresponds to the storage feature provided by your hosting platform, such as the [Cloudflare KV driver](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/cloudflare) or the [Deno KV driver](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/deno). You can also use a cross-platform driver such as [Upstash](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/upstash) or [Redis](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/redis).

:::note
Some drivers may need extra packages to be installed. For example, Upstash requires the `@upstash/redis` package. Some drivers may also require environment variables or credentials to be set.

<ReadMore>
  See [the unstorage driver docs](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers) for more information about each driver, including its `driver` name, any additional dependencies, and usage.
</ReadMore>

:::

### Driver options

You can also pass any available options to the unstorage driver in a separate `session.options` object. See your chosen driver's documentation for available options.

The following example sets a `base` prefix (`"sessions"`) to use for all keys in Upstash:

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={5-7}
  {
    adapter: vercel(),
    session: {
      driver: "upstash",
      options: {
        base: "sessions",
      },
    },
    experimental: {
      session: true,
    },
  }
```

### Other session options

You can configure additional options for sessions in the `session` object.

#### `session.cookie`

<p>

**Type:** `string` | `object`<br />
**Default:** `astro-session`<br />

</p>

Configures the session cookie. This cookie is set in the response when a session is generated. No actual user data is stored in the cookie â€“ just an ID that is used to identify a user's session. The `session.cookie` option can be used to set options for this cookie. You can either provide a `string`, which will be used as the cookie name, or an object which allows additional options:

```js title="astro.config.mjs" {4} ins={6-9}
  {
    session: {
      // If set to a string, this will be used as the cookie name
      // cookie: "my-session-id",
      // If set to an object, this will allow advanced options to be set
      cookie: {
        name: "my-session-id"
        sameSite: "Strict",
      },
    }
  }
```

#### `session.ttl`

<p>
  
**Type:** `number`<br />
**Default:** `undefined`<br />

</p>

An optional default time-to-live expiration period for session values, in seconds.

By default, session values persist until they are deleted or the session is destroyed, and do not automatically expire because a particular amount of time has passed. Set `session.ttl` to add a default expiration period for your session values. Passing a `ttl` option to [`session.set()`](#sessionset) will override the global default for that individual entry.

```js title="astro.config.mjs" {3}
  {
    session: {
      ttl: 60 * 60, // 1 hour
    }
  }
```

:::note
Setting a value for `ttl` does not automatically delete the value from storage after the time limit has passed.

Values from storage will only be deleted when there is an attempt to access them after the `ttl` period has expired. At this time, the session value will be undefined and only then will the value be deleted.

Individual drivers may also support a `ttl` option that will automatically delete sessions after the specified time. See your chosen driver's documentation for more information.
:::

## Using sessions

Once you have configured a driver, you can use the `session` object to interact with the session. The object is accessible as `Astro.session` in your Astro components and pages and on the `context` object in API endpoints, middleware and actions. The API is the same in all cases.

The session is generated automatically when it is first used and can be regenerated at any time with [`Astro.session.regenerate()`](#sessionregenerate) or destroyed with [`Astro.session.destroy()`](#sessiondestroy).

In most cases, you will only need to use [`Astro.session.get()`](#sessionget) and [`Astro.session.set()`](#sessionset). For other available methods, see the [API section](#sessions-api).

### Astro components and pages

In `.astro` components and pages, you can access the session object via the global `Astro` object. For example, to display the number of items in a shopping cart:

```astro title="src/components/CartButton.astro" "Astro.session"
---
export const prerender = false; // Not needed with 'server' output
const cart = await Astro.session.get('cart');
---

<a href="/checkout">ðŸ›’ {cart?.length ?? 0} items</a>
```

### API endpoints

In API endpoints, the session object is available on the `context` object. For example, to add an item to a shopping cart:

```ts title="src/pages/api/addToCart.ts" "context.session"
import type { APIContext } from 'astro';

export async function POST(req: Request, context: APIContext) {
  const cart = await context.session.get('cart');
  cart.push(req.body.item);
  await context.session.set('cart', cart);
  return Response.json(cart);
}
```

### Actions

In actions, the session object is available on the `context` object. For example, to add an item to a shopping cart:

```ts title="src/actions/addToCart.ts" "context.session"
import { defineAction } from 'astro:actions';
import { z } from 'astro:schema';

export const server = {
  addToCart: defineAction({
    input: z.object({ productId: z.string() }),
    handler: async (input, context) => {
      const cart = await context.session.get('cart');
      cart.push(input.productId);
      await context.session.set('cart', cart);
      return cart;
    },
  }),
};
```

### Middleware

:::note
Sessions are not currently supported in edge middleware.
:::

In middleware, the session object is available on the `context` object. For example, to set the last visit time in the session:

```ts title="src/middleware.ts" "context.session"
import { defineMiddleware } from 'astro:middleware';

export const onRequest = defineMiddleware(async (context, next) => {
  context.session.set('lastVisit', new Date());
  return next();
});
```

### Session data types

By default session data is untyped, and you can store arbitrary data in any key. Values are serialized and deserialized using [devalue](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/devalue), which is the same library used in content collections and actions. This means that supported types are the same, and include strings, numbers, `Date`, `Map`, `Set`, `URL`, arrays, and plain objects.

You can optionally define TypeScript types for your session data by creating a `src/env.d.ts` file and adding a declaration for the `App.SessionData` type:

```ts title="src/env.d.ts"
declare namespace App {
  interface SessionData {
    user: {
      id: string;
      name: string;
    };
    cart: string[];
  }
}
```

This will allow you to access the session data with type-checking and auto-completion in your editor:

```ts title="src/components/CartButton.astro"
---
const cart = await Astro.session.get('cart');
// const cart: string[] | undefined

const something = await Astro.session.get('something');
// const something: any

Astro.session.set('user', { id: 1, name: 'Houston' });
// Error: Argument of type '{ id: number; name: string }' is not assignable to parameter of type '{ id: string; name: string; }'.
---
```

:::caution
This is only used for type-checking and does not affect the runtime behavior of the session. Take extra care if you change the type when users have stored data in the session, as this could cause runtime errors.

## Sessions API

Sessions are automatically created when they are first accessed. The session object is available in all Astro contexts, including components, actions, and API endpoints. In components, it is accessed via the global `Astro` object, and in actions and API endpoints, it is available on the `context` object. The API is the same in all cases.

### `session.get()`

<p>

**Type**: `(key: string) => Promise<any>`

</p>

Returns the value of the given key in the session. If the key does not exist, it returns `undefined`.

### `session.set()`

<p>

**Type**: `(key: string, value: any, options?: { ttl: number }) => void`

</p>

Sets the value of the given key in the session. The value can be any serializable type. This method is synchronous and the value is immediately available for retrieval, but it is not saved to the backend until the end of the request.

### `session.regenerate()`

<p>

**Type**: `() => void`

</p>

Regenerates the session ID. Best practice is to call this when a user logs in or escalates their privileges, to prevent session fixation attacks.

### `session.destroy()`

<p>

**Type**: `() => void`

</p>

Destroys the session, deleting the cookie and the object from the backend. This should be called when a user logs out or their session is otherwise invalidated.
