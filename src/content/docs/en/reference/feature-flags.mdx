## Legacy Flags

To help some users migrate between versions of Astro, we occasionally introduce `legacy` flags.
These flags allow you to opt in to some deprecated or otherwise outdated behavior of Astro
in the latest version, so that you can continue to upgrade and take advantage of new Astro releases.

## Experimental Flags

Astro offers experimental flags to give users early access to new features.
These flags are not guaranteed to be stable.
