To help some users migrate between versions of Astro, we occasionally introduce `legacy` flags.

These flags allow you to opt in to some deprecated or otherwise outdated behavior of Astro
in the latest version, so that you can continue to upgrade and take advantage of new Astro releases until you are able to fully update your project code.

There are currently no legacy flags available. When new legacy flags become available, instructions for removing them and upgrading to the latest features of Astro will be listed below.
