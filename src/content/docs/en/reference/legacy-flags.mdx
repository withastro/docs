To help some users migrate between versions of Astro, we occasionally introduce `legacy` flags.

These flags allow you to opt in to some deprecated or otherwise outdated behavior of Astro
in the latest version, so that you can continue to upgrade and take advantage of new Astro releases until you are able to fully update your project code.

Any currently available legacy flags, including instructions for removing them and upgrading to the latest features of Astro, are listed below.
