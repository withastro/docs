> **MissingSharp**: Could not find Sharp. Please install Sharp (`sharp`) manually into your project or migrate to another image service.

## What went wrong?
Sharp is the default image service used for `astro:assets`. When using a [strict package manager](https://pnpm.io/pnpm-vs-npm#npms-flat-tree) like pnpm, Sharp must be installed manually into your project in order to use image processing.

If you are not using `astro:assets` for image processing, and do not wish to install Sharp, you can configure the following passthrough image service that does no processing:

```js
import { defineConfig, passthroughImageService } from "astro/config";
export default defineConfig({
 image: {
   service: passthroughImageService(),
 },
});
```
