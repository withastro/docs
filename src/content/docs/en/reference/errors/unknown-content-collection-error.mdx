## What went wrong?
Astro encountered an unknown error loading your content collections.
This can be caused by certain errors inside your `src/content/config.ts` file or some internal errors.

If you can reliably cause this error to happen, we'd appreciate if you could [open an issue](https://astro.build/issues/)
