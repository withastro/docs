> **NoMatchingStaticPathFound**: A `getStaticPaths()` route pattern was matched, but no matching static path was found for requested path `PATH_NAME`.

## What went wrong?
A [dynamic route](/en/core-concepts/routing/#dynamic-routes) was matched, but no corresponding path was found for the requested parameters. This is often caused by a typo in either the generated or the requested path.
