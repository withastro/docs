> **ExpectedImage**: Expected `src` property to be either an ESM imported image or a string with the path of a remote image. Received `OPTIONS`.

## What went wrong?
An image's `src` property is not valid. The Image component requires the `src` attribute to be either an image that has been ESM imported or a string. This is also true for the first parameter of `getImage()`.

```astro
---
import { Image } from "astro:assets";
import myImage from "../assets/my_image.png";
---

<Image src={myImage} alt="..." />
<Image src="https://example.com/logo.png" width={300} height={300} alt="..." />
```

In most cases, this error happens when the value passed to `src` is undefined.
