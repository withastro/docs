> **InvalidRedirectDestination**: The redirect from "FROM" to "TO" is invalid. The destination "TO" does not match any existing route in your project.

## What went wrong?
A dynamic redirect destination must match an existing route pattern.
This error occurs when a redirect with dynamic parameters points to a destination
that doesn't correspond to any page in your project.
