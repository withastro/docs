> **LocalsNotAnObject**: `locals` can only be assigned to an object. Other values like numbers, strings, etc. are not accepted.

## What went wrong?
Thrown in development mode when `locals` is overwritten with something that is not an object

For example:
```ts
import {defineMiddleware} from "astro:middleware";
export const onRequest = defineMiddleware((context, next) => {
  context.locals = 1541;
  return next();
});
```
