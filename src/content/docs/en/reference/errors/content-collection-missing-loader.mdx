> Collections must have a loader defined. Check your collection definitions in your content config file.

### What went wrong?

A legacy content config file was found. Move the file to `src/content.config.ts` and update any collection definitions if needed.
A content collection is missing a loader definition. Make sure that each collection in your content config file has a loader.
