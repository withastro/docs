Now that you have `.astro` and `.md` files generating entire pages on your website, it's time to make and reuse smaller bits of HTML with Astro components!

## Where are you now?

You can find the code at this point in the tutorial on [GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/blog-tutorial-demo/tree/unit-3/start) or
[StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/withastro/blog-tutorial-demo/tree/unit-3/start?file=src/pages/index.astro).

Check your code against this example, or if you've just joined us, fork on StackBlitz to start coding along in your browser from here.

## Where areyou going?

In this unit, you'll learn how to create **Astro components** to reuse code for common elements across your website. 

You'll build:
- A Navigation component that presents a menu of links to your pages 
- A Footer component to include at the bottom of each page
- A Social Media component, used in the Footer, that links to profile pages
- An interactive Hamburger component to toggle the Navigation on mobile

Along the way, you'll use CSS and JavaScript to build a responsive design that reacts to screen sizes and user input.
