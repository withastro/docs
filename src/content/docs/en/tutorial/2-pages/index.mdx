Now that you have a working site on the web, it's time to add pages and posts!

## Where are you now?

You can find the code at this point in the tutorial on [GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/blog-tutorial-demo/tree/unit-2/start) or
[StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/withastro/blog-tutorial-demo/tree/unit-2/start?file=src/pages/index.astro).

Check your code against this example, or if you've just joined us, fork on StackBlitz to start coding along in your browser from here.

## Where are you going?

In this unit, you'll
- Create your first Astro pages with the `.astro` syntax
- Add blog posts with Markdown (`.md`) files
- Style an individual page with `<style>` 
- Apply global styles across pages

 Along the way, you'll learn how the **two sections of a `.astro` file**  work together to create a page, and how to use variables and conditional rendering on your pages.
