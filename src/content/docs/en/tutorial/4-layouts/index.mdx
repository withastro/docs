Now that you can build with components, it's time to create some custom layouts!

## Where are you now?

You can find the code at this point in the tutorial on [GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/blog-tutorial-demo/tree/unit-4/start) or
[StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/withastro/blog-tutorial-demo/tree/unit-4/start?file=src/pages/index.astro).

Check your code against this example, or if you've just joined us, fork on StackBlitz to start coding along in your browser from here.

## Where are you going?

In this unit, you'll build layouts to share common elements and styles across your pages and blog posts.

To do this, you will:

- Create reusable layout components
- Pass content to your layouts with `<slot />`
- Pass data from Markdown frontmatter to your layouts
- Nest multiple layouts
