## Install Astro's RSS package

Astro provides a custom package to quickly add an RSS feed to your website. 

This official package generates a non-HTML document with information about all of your blog posts that can be read by **feed readers** like Feedly, The Old Reader, and more. This document is updated every time your site is rebuilt.

Individuals can subscribe to your feed in a feed reader, and receive a notification when you publish a new blog post on your site, making it a popular blog feature.

1. Quit the Astro development server and run the following command in the terminal to install Astro's RSS package.

    <PackageManagerTabs>
      <Fragment slot="npm">
      ```shell
      npm install @astrojs/rss
      ```
      </Fragment>
      <Fragment slot="pnpm">
      ```shell
      pnpm install @astrojs/rss
      ```
      </Fragment>
      <Fragment slot="yarn">
      ```shell
      yarn add @astrojs/rss
      ```
      </Fragment>
    </PackageManagerTabs>

2. Restart the dev server to begin working on your Astro project again.

    <PackageManagerTabs>
      <Fragment slot="npm">
      ```shell
      npm run dev
      ```
      </Fragment>
      <Fragment slot="pnpm">
      ```shell
      pnpm run dev
      ```
      </Fragment>
      <Fragment slot="yarn">
      ```shell
      yarn run dev
      ```
      </Fragment>
    </PackageManagerTabs>

## Create an `.xml` feed document

1. Create a new file in `src/pages/` called `rss.xml.js`

2. Copy the following code into this new document, replacing the `site` property with your site's own unique Netlify URL. Customize the `title` and `description` properties, and if necessary, specify a different language in `customData`:

    ```js title="src/pages/rss.xml.js"

    import rss, { pagesGlobToRssItems } from '@astrojs/rss';

    export async function GET() {
      return rss({
        title: 'Astro Learner | Blog',
        description: 'My journey learning Astro',
        site: 'https://my-blog-site.netlify.app',
        items: await pagesGlobToRssItems(import.meta.glob('./**/*.md')),
        customData: `<language>en-us</language>`,
      });
    }
    ```

3. This `rss.xml` document is only created when your site is built, so you won't be able to see this page in your browser during development. Quit the dev server and run the following commands to first, build your site locally and then, view a preview of your build:

    <PackageManagerTabs>
      <Fragment slot="npm">
      ```shell
      npm run build

      npm run preview
      ```
      </Fragment>
      <Fragment slot="pnpm">
      ```shell
      pnpm run build

      pnpm run preview
      ```
      </Fragment>
      <Fragment slot="yarn">
      ```shell
      yarn run build

      yarn run preview
      ```
      </Fragment>
    </PackageManagerTabs>

4. Visit `localhost:3000/rss.xml` and verify that you can see (unformatted) text on the page with an `item` for each of your `.md` files. Each item should contain blog post information such as `title`, `url`, and `description`.

    :::tip[view your rss feed in a reader]
    Download a feed reader, or sign up for an online feed reader service and subscribe to your site by adding your own Netlify URL. You can also share this link with others so they can subscribe to your posts, and be notified when a new one is published.
    :::

5. Be sure to quit the preview and restart the dev server when you want to view your site in development mode again.
