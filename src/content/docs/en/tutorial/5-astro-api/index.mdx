<StackblitzIntro tree="withastro/blog-tutorial-demo/tree/unit-5/start"/>

## Where are we going?

In this unit, you'll supercharge your blog with an index page, tag pages, and an RSS feed. 

Along the way, you'll learn how to use:
- `Astro.glob()` to access data from files in your project
- `getStaticPaths()` to create multiple pages (routes) at once
- The Astro RSS package to create an RSS feed
