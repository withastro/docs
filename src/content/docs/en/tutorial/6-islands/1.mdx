 Use a Preact component to greet your visitors with a randomly-selected welcome message!

<PreCheck>
  - Add Preact to your Astro project
  - Include Astro islands (Preact `.jsx` components) on your home page
  - Use `client:` directives to make islands interactive
</PreCheck>

## Add Preact to your Astro project

1. If it’s running, quit the dev server to have access to the terminal (keyboard shortcut: <kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd>).

2. Add the ability to use Preact components in your Astro project with a single command:

    ```shell
    npx astro add preact
    ```

2. Follow the command line instructions to confirm adding Preact to your project.
 

## Include a Preact greeting banner

This component will take an array of greeting messages as a prop and randomly select one of them to show as a welcome message. The user can click a button to get a new random message.

1. Create a new file in `src/components/` named `Greeting.jsx`

    Note the `.jsx` file extension. This file will be written in Preact, not Astro.

2. Add the following code to `Greeting.jsx`:

    ```jsx title="src/components/Greeting.jsx"
    import { useState } from 'preact/hooks';

    export default function Greeting({messages}) {

      const randomMessage = () => messages[(Math.floor(Math.random() * messages.length))];
      
      const [greeting, setGreeting] = useState(messages[0]);

      return (
        <div> 
          <h3>{greeting}! Thank you for visiting!</h3>
          <button onClick={() => setGreeting(randomMessage())}>
            New Greeting
          </button>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

3. Import and use this component on your Home page `index.astro`.

    ```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" ins={3,8}
    ---
    import BaseLayout from '../layouts/BaseLayout.astro';
    import Greeting from '../components/Greeting.jsx';
    const pageTitle = "Home Page";
    ---
    <BaseLayout pageTitle={pageTitle}>
      <h2>My awesome blog subtitle</h2>
      <Greeting messages={["Hi", "Hello", "Howdy", "Hey there"]} />
    </BaseLayout>
    ```

    Check the preview in your browser: you should see a random greeting, but the button won't work!


4. Add a second `<Greeting />` component with the `client:load` directive.

    ```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" ins={9} "client:load"
    ---
    import BaseLayout from '../layouts/BaseLayout.astro';
    import Greeting from '../components/Greeting';
    const pageTitle = "Home Page";
    ---
    <BaseLayout pageTitle={pageTitle}>
      <h2>My awesome blog subtitle</h2>
      <Greeting messages={["Hi", "Hello", "Howdy", "Hey there"]} />
      <Greeting client:load messages={["Hej", "Hallo", "Hola", "Habari"]} />
    </BaseLayout>
    ```

  5. Revisit your page and compare the two components. The second button works because the `client:load` directive tells Astro to send and rerun its JavaScript to the _client_ when the page _loads_, making the component interactive. We call this a **hydrated** component.
  
  6. Once the difference is clear, remove the non-hydrated Greeting component.


      ```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" del={8} "client:load"
      ---
      import BaseLayout from '../layouts/BaseLayout.astro';
      import Greeting from '../components/Greeting';
      const pageTitle = "Home Page";
      ---
      <BaseLayout pageTitle={pageTitle}>
        <h2>My awesome blog subtitle</h2>
        <Greeting messages={["Hi", "Hello", "Howdy", "Hey there"]} />
        <Greeting client:load messages={["Hej", "Hallo", "Hola", "Habari"]} />
      </BaseLayout>
      ```

### Analyze the Pattern

There are other `client:` directives to explore. Each sends the JavaScript to the client at a different time. `client:visible`, for example, will only send the component's JavaScript when it is visible on the page.

Consider an Astro component with the following code:

```astro
---
import BaseLayout from '../layouts/BaseLayout.astro';
import AstroBanner from '../components/AstroBanner.astro';
import PreactBanner from '../components/PreactBanner';
import SvelteCounter from '../components/SvelteCounter.svelte';
---
<BaseLayout>
  <AstroBanner />
  <PreactBanner />
  <PreactBanner client:load />
  <SvelteCounter />
  <SvelteCounter client:visible />
</BaseLayout>
```

1. Which of the five components will be **hydrated** islands, sending JavaScript to the client?

    <p>
      <Spoiler>`<PreactBanner client:load />` and `<SvelteCounter client:visible />` will be hydrated islands.</Spoiler>
    </p>

2. In what way(s) will the two `<PreactBanner />` components be the same? In what way(s) will they be different? 

    <p>
      <Spoiler>**Same**: They both show the same HTML elements and look the same initially. **Different**: The component with the `client:load` directive will rerender after the page is loaded, and any interactive elements that it has will work.</Spoiler>
    </p>

3. Assume the `SvelteCounter` component shows a number and has a button to increase it. If you couldn't see your website's code, only the live published page, how would you tell which of the two `<SvelteCounter />` components used `client:visible`? 

    <p>
      <Spoiler>Try clicking the button, and see which one is interactive. If it responds to your input, it must have had a `client:` directive.</Spoiler>
    </p>

### Test your knowledge

For each of the following components, identify what will be sent to the browser:

1. `<ReactCounter client:load/>`

    <MultipleChoice>
      <Option>
        HTML and CSS only
      </Option>
      <Option isCorrect>
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
      </Option>
    </MultipleChoice>

2. `<SvelteCard />`

    <MultipleChoice>
      <Option  isCorrect>
        HTML and CSS only
      </Option>
      <Option>
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
      </Option>
    </MultipleChoice>
</Box>

## Checklist

<Checklist>
- [ ] I can install an Astro integration.
- [ ] I can write UI framework components in their own language.
- [ ] I can use a `client:` directive for hydration on my UI framework component.
