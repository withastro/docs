### Component

Astro components are the basic building blocks of any Astro project. They are HTML-only templating components with no client-side runtime. You can spot an Astro component by its file extension: `.astro`. Read more about components in the [Astro Components](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/) page.

### Islands

**Islands** is a frontend architecture that results in better frontend performance by helping you avoid monolithic JavaScript patterns and stripping all non-essential JavaScript from the page automatically. The technique that this architectural pattern builds on is also known as partial or selective hydration. In Astro, an `island` refers to any interactive UI component on the page. Read more about islands in the [Astro Islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) page.
