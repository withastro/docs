Now that you have a working site on the web, it's time to add pages and posts!

## Looking ahead

In this unit, you will:
- Create your first Astro pages with the `.astro` syntax
- Add blog posts with Markdown (`.md`) files
- Style an individual page with `<style>` 
- Apply global styles across pages

 Along the way, you'll learn how the **two sections of a `.astro` file**  work together to create a page, and how to use variables and conditional rendering on your pages.
