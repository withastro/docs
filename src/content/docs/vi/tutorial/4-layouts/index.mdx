Now that you can build with components, it's time to create some custom layouts!

## Looking ahead

In this unit, you'll build layouts to share common elements and styles across your pages and blog posts.

To do this, you will:

- Create reusable layout components
- Pass content to your layouts with `<slot />`
- Pass data from Markdown frontmatter to your layouts
- Nest multiple layouts
