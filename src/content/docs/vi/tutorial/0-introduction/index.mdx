<Lede> In this tutorial, you'll learn Astro's key features by building a fully-functioning blog, from zero to full launch! ðŸš€ </Lede>

Along the way, you'll: 
- Set up your development environment 
- Create pages and blog posts for your website
- Build with Astro components
- Query and work with local files
- Add interactivity to your site 
- Deploy your site to the web

Want a preview of what you're going to build? You can view the final project on [GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/blog-tutorial-demo) or open a working version in an online coding environment such as [IDX](https://idx.google.com/import?url=https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwithastro%2Fblog-tutorial-demo%2F) or [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/withastro/blog-tutorial-demo/tree/complete?file=src%2Fpages%2Findex.astro).


:::note
If you would rather start exploring Astro with a pre-built Astro site, you can visit https://astro.new and choose a starter template to open and edit in an online editor.
