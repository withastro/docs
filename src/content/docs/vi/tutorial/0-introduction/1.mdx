## What do I need to know to get started?

If you have some basic familiarity with **HTML**, **Markdown**, **CSS**, and a little **JavaScript**, then you're totally good to go! You'll be able to complete the entire tutorial just by following the instructions. Astro is for everyone! 🧑‍🚀 👩‍🚀 👨‍🚀 

You will also need a [GitHub](https://github.com) (or similar) account for publishing your project to the web.

<summary>How do I use the checklists at the bottom of each page?</summary>

You check them off!

At the end of each page, you'll find a clickable checklist of tasks you should now be able to do. Check these items off to see your progress in the Tutorial Tracker.

Using the tracker is optional, but it can help you remember your place if you complete the tutorial over multiple visits. You can also leave some checklists blank as a reminder of units that you want to revisit later.

<summary>Unit 1 is things I already know how to do. Can I skip it?</summary>

You can use the lessons inside [Unit 1](/en/tutorial/1-setup/) to make sure you have the development tools and online accounts you'll need to complete the tutorial. It will walk you through creating a new Astro project, storing it on GitHub, and deploying it to Netlify.

If you [create a new, empty Astro project](/en/install-and-setup/) and are comfortable with your setup, you can safely skip ahead to [Unit 2](/en/tutorial/2-pages/) where you will start making new pages in your project.
