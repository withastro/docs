Building a new Astro component? **Publish it to [npm!](https://npmjs.com/)**

Publishing an Astro component is a great way to reuse your existing work across your projects, and to share with the wider Astro community at large. Astro components can be published directly to and installed from NPM, just like any other JavaScript package.

Looking for inspiration? Check out some of our favorite [themes](https://astro.build/themes/) and [components](https://astro.build/integrations/) from the Astro community. You can also [search npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:astro-component,withastro) to see the entire public catalog.

:::tip[Don't want to go it alone?]
Check out [Astro Community's component template](https://github.com/astro-community/component-template) for a community-supported, out-of-the-box template!
:::

## Quick Start

To get started developing your component quickly, you can use a template already set up for you.

```bash
# Initialize the Astro Component template in a new directory
npm create astro@latest my-new-component-directory -- --template component
# yarn
yarn create astro my-new-component-directory --template component
# pnpm
pnpm create astro@latest my-new-component-directory -- --template component
```

## Creating a package

:::note[Prerequisites]
Before diving in, it will help to have a basic understanding of:

- [Node Modules](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-node-js-modules)
- [Package Manifest (`package.json`)](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-package-json-file)
- [Workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json#workspaces)
:::


To create a new package, configure your development environment to use **workspaces** within your project. This will allow you to develop your component alongside a working copy of Astro.

<FileTree>
- my-new-component-directory/
  - demo/
    - ... for testing and demonstration
  - package.json
  - packages/
    - my-component/
      - index.js
      - package.json
      - ... additional files used by the package
</FileTree>

This example, named `my-project`, creates a project with a single package, named `my-component`, and a `demo/` directory for testing and demonstrating the component.

This is configured in the project root’s `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "workspaces": ["demo", "packages/*"]
}
```

In this example, multiple packages can be developed together from the `packages` directory. These packages can also be referenced from `demo`, where you can install a working copy of Astro.

```shell
npm create astro@latest demo -- --template minimal
# yarn
yarn create astro demo --template minimal
# pnpm
pnpm create astro@latest demo -- --template minimal
```

There are two initial files that will make up your individual package: `package.json` and `index.js`.

### `package.json`

The `package.json` in the package directory includes all of the information related to your package, including its description, dependencies, and any other package metadata.

```json
{
  "name": "my-component",
  "description": "Component description",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "homepage": "https://github.com/owner/project#readme",
  "type": "module",
  "exports": {
    ".": "./index.js",
    "./astro": "./MyAstroComponent.astro",
    "./react": "./MyReactComponent.jsx"
  },
  "files": ["index.js", "MyAstroComponent.astro", "MyReactComponent.jsx"],
  "keywords": ["astro", "withastro", "astro-component", "...", "..."]
}
```

#### `description`

A short description of your component used to help others know what it does.

```json
{
  "description": "An Astro Element Generator"
}
```

#### `type`

The module format used by Node.js and Astro to interpret your `index.js` files.

```json
{
  "type": "module"
}
```

Use `"type": "module"` so that your `index.js` can be used as an entrypoint with `import` and `export` .

#### `homepage`

The url to the project homepage.

```json
{
  "homepage": "https://github.com/owner/project#readme"
}
```

This is a great way to direct users to an online demo, documentation, or homepage for your project.

#### `exports`

The entry points of a package when imported by name.

```json
{
  "exports": {
    ".": "./index.js",
    "./astro": "./MyAstroComponent.astro",
    "./react": "./MyReactComponent.jsx"
  }
}
```

In this example, importing `my-component` would use `index.js`, while importing `my-component/astro` or `my-component/react` would use `MyAstroComponent.astro` or `MyReactComponent.jsx` respectively.

#### `files`

An optional optimization to exclude unnecessary files from the bundle shipped to users via npm. Note that **only files listed here will be included in your package**, so if you add or change files necessary for your package to work, you must update this list accordingly.

```json
{
  "files": ["index.js", "MyAstroComponent.astro", "MyReactComponent.jsx"]
}
```

#### `keywords`

An array of keywords relevant to your component, used to help others [find your component on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:astro-component,withastro) and in any other search catalogs.

Add `astro-component` or `withastro` as a special keyword to maximize its discoverability in the Astro ecosystem.

```json
{
  "keywords": ["astro-component", "withastro", "... etc", "... etc"]
}
```

:::tip
Keywords are also used by our [integrations library](https://astro.build/integrations/)! [See below](#integrations-library) for a full list of keywords we look for in NPM.
:::

---

### `index.js`

The main **package entrypoint** used whenever your package is imported.

```js
export { default as MyAstroComponent } from './MyAstroComponent.astro';

export { default as MyReactComponent } from './MyReactComponent.jsx';
```

This allows you to package multiple components together into a single interface.

#### Example: Using Named Imports

```astro
---
import { MyAstroComponent } from 'my-component';
import { MyReactComponent } from 'my-component';
---
<MyAstroComponent />
<MyReactComponent />
```

#### Example: Using Namespace Imports

```astro
---
import * as Example from 'example-astro-component';
---
<Example.MyAstroComponent />
<Example.MyReactComponent />
```

#### Example: Using Individual Imports

```astro
---
import MyAstroComponent from 'example-astro-component/astro';
import MyReactComponent from 'example-astro-component/react';
---
<MyAstroComponent />
<MyReactComponent />
```

## Developing your package

Astro does not have a dedicated "package mode" for development. Instead, you should use a demo project to develop and test your package inside of your project. This can be a private website only used for development, or a public demo/documentation website for your package.

If you are extracting components from an existing project, you can even continue to use that project to develop your now-extracted components.

## Testing your component

Astro does not currently ship a test runner. _(If you are interested in helping out with this, [join us on Discord!](https://astro.build/chat))_

In the meantime, our current recommendation for testing is:

<Steps>
1. Add a test `fixtures` directory to your `demo/src/pages` directory.

2. Add a new page for every test that you'd like to run.

3. Each page should include some different component usage that you'd like to test.

4. Run `astro build` to build your fixtures, then compare the output of the `dist/__fixtures__/` directory to what you expected.
   <FileTree>
   - my-project/demo/src/pages/\_\_fixtures\_\_/
     - test-name-01.astro
     - test-name-02.astro
     - test-name-03.astro
   </FileTree>
</Steps>


## Publishing your component

Once you have your package ready, you can publish it to npm using the `npm publish` command. If that fails, make sure that you have logged in via `npm login` and that your `package.json` is correct. If it succeeds, you're done!

Notice that there was no `build` step for Astro packages. Any file type that Astro supports natively, such as `.astro`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, and `.css`, can be published directly without a build step. 

If you need another file type that isn't natively supported by Astro, add a build step to your package. This advanced exercise is left up to you.

## Integrations Library

Share your hard work by adding your integration to our [integrations library](https://astro.build/integrations/)!

:::tip
Do you need some help building your integration, or just want to meet other integrations builders? We have a dedicated `#integrations` channel on our [Discord server](https://astro.build/chat). Come say hi!
:::

### `package.json` data

The library is automatically updated weekly, pulling in every package published to NPM with the `astro-component` or `withastro` keyword.

The integrations library reads the `name`, `description`, `repository`, and `homepage` data from your `package.json`.

Avatars are a great way to highlight your brand in the library! Once your package is published you can [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/withastro/astro.build/issues/new/choose) with your avatar attached and we will add it to your listing.

:::tip
Need to override the information our library reads from NPM? No problem! [File an issue](https://github.com/withastro/astro.build/issues/new/choose) with the updated information and we'll make sure the custom `name`, `description`, or `homepage` is used instead.
:::

### Categories

In addition to the required `astro-component` or `withastro` keyword, special keywords are also used to automatically organize packages. Including any of the keywords below will add your integration to the matching category in our integrations library.

| category          | keywords                                     |
|------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Accessibility     | `a11y`, `accessibility`                      |
| Adapters          | `astro-adapter`                              |
| Analytics         | `analytics`                                  |
| CSS + UI          | `css`, `ui`, `icon`, `icons`, `renderer`     |
| Frameworks        | `renderer`                                   |
| Content Loaders   | `astro-loader`                               |
| Images + Media    | `media`, `image`, `images`, `video`, `audio` |
| Performance + SEO | `performance`, `perf`, `seo`, `optimization` |
| Dev Toolbar       | `devtools`, `dev-overlay`, `dev-toolbar`     |
| Utilities         | `tooling`, `utils`, `utility`                |

Packages that don't include any keyword matching a category will be shown as `Uncategorized`.
