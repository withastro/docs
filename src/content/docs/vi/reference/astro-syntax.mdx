Astro component syntax is a superset of HTML. The syntax was designed to feel familiar to anyone with experience writing HTML or JSX, and adds support for including components and JavaScript expressions.


## JSX-like Expressions

You can define local JavaScript variables inside of the frontmatter component script between the two code fences (`---`) of an Astro component. You can then inject these variables into the component's HTML template using JSX-like expressions!

:::note[Dynamic vs reactive]
Using this approach, you can include **dynamic** values that are calculated in the frontmatter. But once included, these values are not **reactive** and will never change. Astro components are templates that only run once, during the rendering step.

See below for more examples of [differences between Astro and JSX](#differences-between-astro-and-jsx).
:::

### Variables

Local variables can be added into the HTML using the curly braces syntax:

```astro title="src/components/Variables.astro" "{name}"
---
const name = "Astro";
---
<div>
  <h1>Hello {name}!</h1>  <!-- Outputs <h1>Hello Astro!</h1> -->
</div>
```

### Dynamic Attributes

Local variables can be used in curly braces to pass attribute values to both HTML elements and components:

```astro title="src/components/DynamicAttributes.astro" "{name}" "${name}"
---
const name = "Astro";
---
<h1 class={name}>Attribute expressions are supported</h1>

<MyComponent templateLiteralNameAttribute={`MyNameIs${name}`} />
```

:::caution
HTML attributes will be converted to strings, so it is not possible to pass functions and objects to HTML elements.
For example, you can't assign an event handler to an HTML element in an Astro component:

```astro title="dont-do-this.astro"
---
function handleClick () {
    console.log("button clicked!");
}
---
<!-- ❌ This doesn't work! ❌ -->
<button onClick={handleClick}>Nothing will happen when you click me!</button>
```

Instead, use a client-side script to add the event handler, like you would in vanilla JavaScript:

```astro title="do-this-instead.astro"
---
---
<button id="button">Click Me</button>
<script>
  function handleClick () {
    console.log("button clicked!");
  }
  document.getElementById("button").addEventListener("click", handleClick);
</script>
```
:::

### Dynamic HTML

Local variables can be used in JSX-like functions to produce dynamically-generated HTML elements:

```astro title="src/components/DynamicHtml.astro" "{item}"
---
const items = ["Dog", "Cat", "Platypus"];
---
<ul>
  {items.map((item) => (
    <li>{item}</li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

Astro can conditionally display HTML using JSX logical operators and ternary expressions.

```astro title="src/components/ConditionalHtml.astro" "visible"
---
const visible = true;
---
{visible && <p>Show me!</p>}

{visible ? <p>Show me!</p> : <p>Else show me!</p>}
```

### Dynamic Tags

You can also use dynamic tags by assigning an HTML tag name to a variable or with a component import reassignment:

```astro title="src/components/DynamicTags.astro" /Element|(?<!My)Component/
---
import MyComponent from "./MyComponent.astro";
const Element = 'div'
const Component = MyComponent;
---
<Element>Hello!</Element> <!-- renders as <div>Hello!</div> -->
<Component /> <!-- renders as <MyComponent /> -->
```

When using dynamic tags:

- **Variable names must be capitalized.** For example, use `Element`, not `element`. Otherwise, Astro will try to render your variable name as a literal HTML tag.

- **Hydration directives are not supported.** When using [`client:*` hydration directives](/en/guides/framework-components/#hydrating-interactive-components), Astro needs to know which components to bundle for production, and the dynamic tag pattern prevents this from working.

- **The [define:vars directive](/en/reference/directives-reference/#definevars) is not supported.** If you cannot wrap the children with an extra element (e.g `<div>`), then you can manually add a ``style={`--myVar:${value}`}`` to your Element.

### Fragments

Astro supports `<> </>` notation and also provides a built-in `<Fragment />` component. This component can be useful to avoid wrapper elements when adding [`set:*` directives](/en/reference/directives-reference/#sethtml) to inject an HTML string.

The following example renders paragraph text using the `<Fragment />` component:

```astro title="src/components/SetHtml.astro" "Fragment"
---
const htmlString = '<p>Raw HTML content</p>';
---
<Fragment set:html={htmlString} />
```

### Differences between Astro and JSX

Astro component syntax is a superset of HTML. It was designed to feel familiar to anyone with HTML or JSX experience, but there are a couple of key differences between `.astro` files and JSX.

#### Attributes

In Astro, you use the standard `kebab-case` format for all HTML attributes instead of the `camelCase` used in JSX. This even works for `class`, which is not supported by React.

```jsx del={1} ins={2} title="example.astro"
<div className="box" dataValue="3" />
<div class="box" data-value="3" />
```

#### Multiple Elements

An Astro component template can render multiple elements with no need to wrap everything in a single `<div>` or `<>`, unlike JavaScript or JSX.

```astro title="src/components/RootElements.astro"
---
// Template with multiple elements
---
<p>No need to wrap elements in a single containing element.</p>
<p>Astro supports multiple root elements in a template.</p>
```

#### Comments

In Astro, you can use standard HTML comments or JavaScript-style comments.

```astro title="example.astro"
---
---
<!-- HTML comment syntax is valid in .astro files -->
{/* JS comment syntax is also valid */}
```

:::caution
HTML-style comments will be included in browser DOM, while JS ones will be skipped. To leave TODO messages or other development-only explanations, you may wish to use JavaScript-style comments instead.

## Component utilities

### `Astro.slots`

`Astro.slots` contains utility functions for modifying an Astro component's slotted children.

#### `Astro.slots.has()`

<p>

**Type:** `(slotName: string) => boolean`
</p>

You can check whether content for a specific slot name exists with `Astro.slots.has()`. This can be useful when you want to wrap slot contents but only want to render the wrapper elements when the slot is being used.

```astro  title="src/pages/index.astro"
---
---
<slot />

{Astro.slots.has('more') && (
  <aside>
    <h2>More</h2>
    <slot name="more" />
  </aside>
)}
```

#### `Astro.slots.render()`

<p>

**Type:** `(slotName: string, args?: any[]) => Promise<string>`
</p>

You can asynchronously render the contents of a slot to a string of HTML using `Astro.slots.render()`.

```astro
---
const html = await Astro.slots.render('default');
---
<Fragment set:html={html} />
```

:::note
This is for advanced use cases! In most circumstances, it is simpler to render slot contents with [the `<slot />` element](/en/basics/astro-components/#slots).
:::

`Astro.slots.render()` optionally accepts a second argument: an array of parameters that will be forwarded to any function children. This can be useful for custom utility components.

For example, this `<Shout />` component converts its `message` prop to uppercase and passes it to the default slot:

```astro title="src/components/Shout.astro" "await Astro.slots.render('default', [message])"
---
const message = Astro.props.message.toUpperCase();
let html = '';
if (Astro.slots.has('default')) {
  html = await Astro.slots.render('default', [message]);
}
---
<Fragment set:html={html} />
```

A callback function passed as `<Shout />`’s child will receive the all-caps `message` parameter:

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
---
import Shout from "../components/Shout.astro";
---
<Shout message="slots!">
  {(message) => <div>{message}</div>}
</Shout>

<!-- renders as <div>SLOTS!</div> -->
```

Callback functions can be passed to named slots inside a wrapping HTML element tag with a `slot` attribute. This element is only used to transfer the callback to a named slot and will not be rendered onto the page.

```astro
<Shout message="slots!">
  <fragment slot="message">
    {(message) => <div>{message}</div>}
  </fragment>
</Shout>
```

Use a standard HTML element for the wrapping tag or any lowercase tag (e.g. `<fragment>` instead of `<Fragment />`) that will not be interpreted as a component.  Do not use the HTML `<slot>` element as this will be interpreted as an Astro slot.

### `Astro.self`

`Astro.self` allows Astro components to be recursively called. This behavior lets you render an Astro component from within itself by using `<Astro.self>` in the component template. This can help iterate over large data stores and nested data structures.

```astro
---
// NestedList.astro
const { items } = Astro.props;
---
<ul class="nested-list">
  {items.map((item) => (
    <li>
      <!-- If there is a nested data-structure we render `<Astro.self>` -->
      <!-- and can pass props through with the recursive call -->
      {Array.isArray(item) ? (
        <Astro.self items={item} />
      ) : (
        item
      )}
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

This component could then be used like this:

```astro
---
import NestedList from './NestedList.astro';
---
<NestedList items={['A', ['B', 'C'], 'D']} />
```

And would render HTML like this:

```html
<ul class="nested-list">
  <li>A</li>
  <li>
    <ul class="nested-list">
      <li>B</li>
      <li>C</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>D</li>
</ul>
```
