> **i18nNoLocaleFoundInPath**: You tried to use an i18n utility on a path that doesn't contain any locale. You can use `pathHasLocale` first to determine if the path has a locale.

## What went wrong?
An i18n utility tried to use the locale from a URL path that does not contain one. You can prevent this error by using pathHasLocale to check URLs for a locale first before using i18n utilities.
