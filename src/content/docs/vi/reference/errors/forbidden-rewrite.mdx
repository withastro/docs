import DontEditWarning from '~/components/DontEditWarning.astro'

<DontEditWarning />


> **ForbiddenRewrite**: You tried to rewrite the on-demand route 'FROM' with the static route 'TO', when using the 'server' output. <br/><br/>The static route 'TO' is rendered by the component
'COMPONENT', which is marked as prerendered. This is a forbidden operation because during the build the component 'COMPONENT' is compiled to an
HTML file, which can't be retrieved at runtime by Astro.

## What went wrong?
`Astro.rewrite()` can't be used to rewrite an on-demand route with a static route when using the `"server"` output.
