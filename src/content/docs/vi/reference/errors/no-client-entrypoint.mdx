<DontEditWarning />


> **NoClientEntrypoint**: `COMPONENT_NAME` component has a `client:CLIENT_DIRECTIVE` directive, but no client entrypoint was provided by `RENDERER_NAME`.

## What went wrong?
Astro tried to hydrate a component on the client, but the renderer used does not provide a client entrypoint to use to hydrate.
