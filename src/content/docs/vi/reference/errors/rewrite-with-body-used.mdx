> **RewriteWithBodyUsed**: Astro.rewrite() cannot be used if the request body has already been read. If you need to read the body, first clone the request.

## What went wrong?
`Astro.rewrite()` cannot be used if the request body has already been read. If you need to read the body, first clone the request. For example:

```js
const data = await Astro.request.clone().formData();

Astro.rewrite("/target")
```
