<DontEditWarning />


> **Example error message:**<br/>
The loader for **blog** returned invalid data.<br/>
Object is missing required property "id".

## What went wrong?
The loader for a content collection returned invalid data.
Inline loaders must return an array of objects with unique ID fields or a plain object with IDs as keys and entries as values.
