> **LocalsNotSerializable**: The information stored in `Astro.locals` for the path "`HREF`" is not serializable. Make sure you store only serializable data. (E03034)

## What went wrong?
Thrown in development mode when a user attempts to store something that is not serializable in `locals`.

For example:
```ts
import {defineMiddleware} from "astro/middleware";
export const onRequest = defineMiddleware((context, next) => {
  context.locals = {
    foo() {
      alert("Hello world!")
    }
  };
  return next();
});
```
