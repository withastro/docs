> **ActionQueryStringInvalidError**: The server received the query string `?_astroAction=ACTION_NAME`, but could not find an action with that name. If you changed an action's name in development, remove this query param from your URL and refresh.

## What went wrong?
The server received the query string `?_astroAction=name`, but could not find an action with that name. Use the action function's `.queryString` property to retrieve the form `action` URL.
