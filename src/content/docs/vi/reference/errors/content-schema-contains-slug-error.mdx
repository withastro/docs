> **ContentSchemaContainsSlugError**: A content collection schema should not contain `slug` since it is reserved for slug generation. Remove this from your COLLECTION_NAME collection schema.

## What went wrong?
A legacy content collection schema should not contain the `slug` field. This is reserved by Astro for generating entry slugs. Remove `slug` from your schema. You can still use custom slugs in your frontmatter.
