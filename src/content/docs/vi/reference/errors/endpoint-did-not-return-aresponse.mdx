> **EndpointDidNotReturnAResponse**: An endpoint must return either a `Response`, or a `Promise` that resolves with a `Response`.

## What went wrong?
Thrown when an endpoint does not return anything or returns an object that is not a `Response` object.

An endpoint must return either a `Response`, or a `Promise` that resolves with a `Response`. For example:
```ts
import type { APIContext } from 'astro';

export async function GET({ request, url, cookies }: APIContext): Promise<Response> {
    return Response.json({
        success: true,
        result: 'Data from Astro Endpoint!'
    })
}
```
