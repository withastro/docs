<DontEditWarning />


> **CantRenderPage**: Astro cannot find any content to render for this route. There is no file or redirect associated with this route.

## What went wrong?
Astro could not find an associated file with content while trying to render the route. This is an Astro error and not a user error. If restarting the dev server does not fix the problem, please file an issue.
