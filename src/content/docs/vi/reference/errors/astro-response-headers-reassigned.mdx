> **AstroResponseHeadersReassigned**: Individual headers can be added to and removed from `Astro.response.headers`, but it must not be replaced with another instance of `Headers` altogether.

## What went wrong?
Thrown when a value is being set as the `headers` field on the `ResponseInit` object available as `Astro.response`.
