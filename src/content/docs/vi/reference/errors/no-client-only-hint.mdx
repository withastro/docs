title: Missing hint on client:only directive.

import DontEditWarning from '~/components/DontEditWarning.astro'

<DontEditWarning />


> **NoClientOnlyHint**: Unable to render `COMPONENT_NAME`. When using the `client:only` hydration strategy, Astro needs a hint to use the correct renderer.

## What went wrong?
`client:only` components are not run on the server, as such Astro does not know (and cannot guess) which renderer to use and require a hint. Like such:

```astro
	<SomeReactComponent client:only="react" />
```
