> **ImageNotFound**: Could not find requested image `IMAGE_PATH`. Does it exist?

## What went wrong?
Astro could not find an image you imported. Often, this is simply caused by a typo in the path.

Images in Markdown are relative to the current file. To refer to an image that is located in the same folder as the `.md` file, the path should start with `./`
