## What went wrong?
Astro could not import the requested file. Oftentimes, this is caused by the import path being wrong (either because the file does not exist, or there is a typo in the path)

This message can also appear when a type is imported without specifying that it is a [type import](/en/guides/typescript/#type-imports).
