> **ExpectedNotESMImage**: An ESM-imported image cannot be passed directly to `getImage()`. Instead, pass an object with the image in the `src` property.

## What went wrong?
An ESM-imported image cannot be passed directly to `getImage()`. Instead, pass an object with the image in the `src` property.

```diff
import { getImage } from "astro:assets";
import myImage from "../assets/my_image.png";
- const optimizedImage = await getImage( myImage );
+ const optimizedImage = await getImage({ src: myImage });
```
