> **GetStaticPathsRequired**: `getStaticPaths()` function is required for dynamic routes. Make sure that you `export` a `getStaticPaths` function from your dynamic route.

## What went wrong?
In [Static Mode](/en/guides/routing/#static-ssg-mode), all routes must be determined at build time. As such, dynamic routes must `export` a `getStaticPaths` function returning the different paths to generate.
