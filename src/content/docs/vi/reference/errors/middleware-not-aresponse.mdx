> **MiddlewareNotAResponse**: Any data returned from middleware must be a valid `Response` object.

## What went wrong?
Thrown in development mode when middleware returns something that is not a `Response` object.

For example:
```ts
import {defineMiddleware} from "astro:middleware";
export const onRequest = defineMiddleware(() => {
  return "string"
});
```
