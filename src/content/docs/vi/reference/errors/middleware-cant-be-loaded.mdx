> **MiddlewareCantBeLoaded**: An unknown error was thrown while loading your middleware.

## What went wrong?
Thrown in development mode when middleware throws an error while attempting to loading it.

For example:
```ts
import {defineMiddleware} from "astro:middleware";
throw new Error("Error thrown while loading the middleware.")
export const onRequest = defineMiddleware(() => {
  return "string"
});
```
