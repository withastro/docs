> **UnsupportedImageFormat**: Received unsupported format `FORMAT` from `IMAGE_PATH`. Currently only SUPPORTED_FORMATS.JOIN(', ') are supported by our image services.

## What went wrong?
The built-in image services do not currently support optimizing all image formats.

For unsupported formats such as GIFs, you may be able to use an `img` tag directly:
```astro
---
import rocket from '../assets/images/rocket.gif';
---

<img src={rocket.src} width={rocket.width} height={rocket.height} alt="A rocketship in space." />
```
