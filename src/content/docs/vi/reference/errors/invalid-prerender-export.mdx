> **Example error messages:**<br/>
InvalidPrerenderExport: A `prerender` export has been detected, but its value cannot be statically analyzed.

## What went wrong?
The `prerender` feature only supports a subset of valid JavaScript â€” be sure to use exactly `export const prerender = true` so that our compiler can detect this directive at build time. Variables, `let`, and `var` declarations are not supported.
