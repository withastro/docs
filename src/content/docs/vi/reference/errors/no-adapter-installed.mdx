<DontEditWarning />


> **NoAdapterInstalled**: Cannot use server-rendered pages without an adapter. Please install and configure the appropriate server adapter for your final deployment.

## What went wrong?
To use server-side rendering, an adapter needs to be installed so Astro knows how to generate the proper output for your targeted deployment platform.
