> Missing width and height attributes for `IMAGE_URL`. When using remote images, both dimensions are required in order to avoid cumulative layout shift (CLS).

## What went wrong?
For remote images, `width` and `height` cannot automatically be inferred from the original file. To avoid cumulative layout shift (CLS), either specify these two properties, or set [`inferSize`](/en/reference/modules/astro-assets/#infersize) to `true` to fetch a remote image's original dimensions.

If your image is inside your `src` folder, you probably meant to import it instead. See [the Imports guide for more information](/en/guides/imports/#other-assets).
