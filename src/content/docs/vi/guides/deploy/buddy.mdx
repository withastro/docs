You can deploy your Astro project using [Buddy](https://buddy.works/), a CI/CD solution that can build your site and push it to many different deploy targets including FTP servers and cloud hosting providers.

:::note
Buddy itself will not host your site. Instead, it helps you manage the build process and deliver the result to a deploy platform of your choice.

## How to deploy

<Steps>
1. [Create a **Buddy** account](https://buddy.works/sign-up).

2. Create a new project and connect it with a git repository (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, any private Git Repository or you can use Buddy Git Hosting).

3. Add a new pipeline.

4. In the newly created pipeline add a **[Node.js](https://buddy.works/actions/node-js)** action.

5. In this action add:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

6. Add a deployment action — there are many to choose from, you can browse them in [Buddy’s actions catalog](https://buddy.works/actions). Although their settings can differ, remember to set the **Source path** to `dist`.

7. Press the **Run** button.
