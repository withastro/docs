You can use [Fleek](http://fleek.xyz/) to deploy a static Astro site to their edge-optimized decentralized network.

This guide gives a complete walkthrough of deploying your Astro site to Fleek using the Fleek UI and CLI.

## Project Configuration

Your Astro project can be deployed to Fleek as a static site.

## How to deploy

You can deploy to Fleek through the website UI or using Fleekâ€™s CLI (command line interface).

### Platform UI Deployment

<Steps>
1. Create a [Fleek](https://app.fleek.xyz) account.

2. Push your code to your online Git repository (GitHub).

3. Import your project into Fleek.

4. Fleek will automatically detect Astro and then you can configure the correct settings.

5. Your application is deployed!
</Steps>


### Fleek CLI

<Steps>
1. Install the Fleek CLI.

    ```bash
    # You need to have Nodejs >= 18.18.2
    npm install -g @fleek-platform/cli
    ```
2. Log in to your Fleek account from your terminal.

    ```bash
    fleek login
    ```

3. Run the build command to generate the static files. By default, these will be located in the `dist/` directory.

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

4. Initialize your project. This will generate a configuration file.

    ```bash
    fleek sites init
    ```

5. You will be prompted to either create a new Fleek Site or use an existing one. Give the site a name and select the directory where your project is located.

6. Deploy your site.

    ```bash
    fleek sites deploy
    ```
