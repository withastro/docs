You can deploy your Astro project to [Fly.io](https://fly.io/), a platform for running full stack apps and databases close to your users.

## Project Configuration

Your Astro project can be deployed to Fly.io as a static site, or as a server-side rendered site (SSR).

### Static Site

Your Astro project is a static site by default. You donâ€™t need any extra configuration to deploy a static Astro site to Fly.io.

### Adapter for SSR

To enable on-demand rendering in your Astro project and deploy on Fly.io, add [the Node.js adapter](/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/).

## How to deploy

<Steps>
1. [Sign up for Fly.io](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/log-in-to-fly/#first-time-or-no-fly-account-sign-up-for-fly) if you haven't already.

2. [Install `flyctl`](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/), your Fly.io app command center.

3. Run the following command in your terminal.

    ```bash
    fly launch
    ```

	`flyctl` will automatically detect Astro, configure the correct settings, build your image, and deploy it to the Fly.io platform. 
</Steps>

## Generating your Astro Dockerfile

If you don't already have a Dockerfile, `fly launch` will generate one for you, as well as prepare a `fly.toml` file. For pages rendered on demand, this Dockerfile will include the appropriate start command and environment variables.

You can instead create your own Dockerfile using [Dockerfile generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flydotio/dockerfile) and then run using the command `npx dockerfile` for Node applications or `bunx dockerfile` for Bun applications.
