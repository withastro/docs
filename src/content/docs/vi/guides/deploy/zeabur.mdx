[Zeabur](https://zeabur.com) offers hosting for full-stack web applications. Astro sites can be hosted as both SSR or static output.

This guide includes instructions for deploying to Zeabur through the website UI.

## Project Configuration

### Static Site

Astro outputs a static site by default. There is no need for any extra configuration to deploy a static Astro site to Zeabur. 

### Adapter for SSR

To enable SSR in your Astro project and deploy on Zeabur:

<Steps>
1. Install [the `@zeabur/astro-adapter` adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zeabur/astro-adapter) to your project’s dependencies using your preferred package manager. If you’re using npm or aren’t sure, run this in the terminal:

    ```bash
      npm install @zeabur/astro-adapter
    ```

2. Add two new lines to your `astro.config.mjs` project configuration file.

    ```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={2, 5-6}
    import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
    import zeabur from '@zeabur/astro-adapter/serverless';

    export default defineConfig({
      output: 'server',
      adapter: zeabur(),
    });
    ```
</Steps>

## How to deploy

You can deploy your Astro site to Zeabur if the project is stored in GitHub.

<Steps>
1. Click <kbd>Create new project</kbd> in the [Zeabur dashboard](https://dash.zeabur.com).

2. Configure GitHub installation and import the repository.

3. Zeabur will automatically detect that your project is an Astro project and will build it using the `astro build` command.

4. Once the build is complete, you can bind a domain to your site and visit it.
</Steps>

After your project has been imported and deployed, all subsequent pushes to branches will generate new builds.
