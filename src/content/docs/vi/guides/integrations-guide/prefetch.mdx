:::caution[Removed]
`@astrojs/prefetch` has been replaced by the [built-in `prefetch` feature](/en/guides/prefetch/) introduced in Astro 3.5. See the [migration guide](/en/guides/prefetch/#migrating-from-astrojsprefetch) for instructions on updating an older project.

If you are still using this integration in a pre-v3.5 Astro project, you can read an archived copy of [the `@astrojs/prefetch` README](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/c47478bbf6b21973419f25234c68efb59466b368/packages%2Fintegrations%2Fprefetch%2FREADME.md) on GitHub.
