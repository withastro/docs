The Deno adapter allows Astro to deploy your SSR site to Deno targets including Deno Deploy. 

The Deno adapter was previously maintained by Astro but now is maintained by Deno directly. Usage is now documented [in the Deno adapter repository](https://github.com/denoland/deno-astro-adapter).

If you are currently using this Astro adapter, you will need to migrate to the new Deno version or to [add another adapter](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/) to continue using SSR in your project.
