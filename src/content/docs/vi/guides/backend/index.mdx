## What is a backend service?

A backend service is a cloud-based system that helps you build and manage your backend infrastructure. It provides a set of tools and services for managing databases, user authentication, and other server-side functionality. This enables you to focus on building your applications without having to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure.

## Why would I use a backend service?

You might want to consider a backend service if your project has complex server-side needs, for example:
- user sign-ups and authentication
- persistent data storage
- user-uploaded asset storage
- API generation
- realtime communication
- application monitoring
