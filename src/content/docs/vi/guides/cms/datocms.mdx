[DatoCMS](https://datocms.com/) is a web-based, headless CMS to manage digital content for your sites and apps.

## Integrating with Astro

In this guide, you will fetch content data from DatoCMS in your Astro project, then display it on a page.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you will need to have the following:

- **An Astro project** - If you don’t have an Astro project yet, you can follow the instructions in our [Installation guide](/en/install-and-setup/).
- **A DatoCMS account and project** - If you don't have an account, you can [sign up for a free account](https://dashboard.datocms.com/signup).
- **The read-only API Key for your DatoCMS project** - You can find it in the admin dashboard of your project, under "Settings" > "API Tokens".

## Setting up the credentials

Create a new file (if one does not already exist) named `.env` in the root of your Astro project. Add a new environment variable as follows, using the API key found in your DatoCMS admin dashboard: 

```ini title=".env"
DATOCMS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

For TypeScript support, declare the typing of this environment variable in the `env.d.ts` file in the `src/` folder. If this file does not exist, you can create it and add the following:

```ts title="src/env.d.ts"
interface ImportMetaEnv {
  readonly DATOCMS_API_KEY: string;
}
```

Your root directory should now include these files:

<FileTree title="Project Structure">
- src/
  - **env.d.ts**
- **.env**
- astro.config.mjs
- package.json
</FileTree>

## Create a Model in DatoCMS

In the DatoCMS admin dashboard of your project, navigate to "Settings" > "Models" and create a new Model called "Home" with the "Single Instance" toggle selected. This will create a home page for your project. In this model, add a new text field for the page title.

Navigate to the "Content" tab in your project and click on your newly-created home page. You can now add a title. Save the page, and continue.

## Fetching data

In your Astro project, navigate to the page that will fetch and display your CMS content. Add the following query to fetch the content for `home` using the DatoCMS GraphQL API.

This example displays the page title from DatoCMS on `src/pages/index.astro`:

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
---
const response = await fetch('https://graphql.datocms.com/', {
	method: 'POST',
	headers: {
		'Content-Type': 'application/json',
		Accept: 'application/json',
		Authorization: `Bearer ${import.meta.env.DATOCMS_API_KEY}`,
	},
	body: JSON.stringify({
		query: `query Homepage {
          home {
            title
          }
        }
      `,
	}),
});

const json = await response.json();
const data = json.data.home;
---

<h1>{data.title}</h1>
```

This GraphQL query will fetch the `title` field in the `home` page from your DatoCMS Project. When you refresh your browser, you should see the title on your page.

## Adding Dynamic modular content blocks

If your DatosCMS project includes [modular content](https://www.datocms.com/docs/content-modelling/modular-content), then you will need to build a corresponding `.astro` component for each block of content (e.g. a text section, a video, a quotation block, etc.) that the modular field allows in your project.

The example below is a `<Text />` Astro component for displaying a "Multiple-paragraph text" block from DatoCMS. 

```astro title="src/components/Text.astro"
---
export interface TextProps {
	text: string
}

export interface Props {
	item: TextProps
}

const { item } = Astro.props;
---

<div set:html={item.text} />

```
To fetch these blocks, edit your GraphQL query to include the modular content block you created in DatoCMS. 

In this example, the modular content block is named **content** in DatoCMS. This query also includes the unique `_modelApiKey` of each item to check which block should be displayed in the modular field, based on which block was chosen by the content author in the DatoCMS editor. Use a switch statement in the Astro template to allow for dynamic rendering based on the data received from the query.

The following example represents a DatoCMS modular content block that allows an author to choose between a text field (`<Text />`) and an image (`<Image />`) rendered on the home page:

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" ins={2,3, 16-27, 39-50}
---
import Image from '../components/Image.astro';
import Text from '../components/Text.astro';

const response = await fetch('https://graphql.datocms.com/', {
	method: 'POST',
	headers: {
		'Content-Type': 'application/json',
		Accept: 'application/json',
		Authorization: `Bearer ${import.meta.env.DATOCMS_API_KEY}`,
	},
	body: JSON.stringify({
		query: `query Homepage {
          home {
            title
            content {
              ... on ImageRecord {
                _modelApiKey
               image{
                url
               }
              }
              ... on TextRecord {
                _modelApiKey
                text(markdown: true)
              }
            }
          }
        }
      `,
	}),
});

const json = await response.json();
const data = json.data.home;
---

<h1>{data.title}</h1>
{
  data.content.map((item: any) => {
    switch (item._modelApiKey) {
      case 'image':
        return <Image item={item} />;
      case 'text':
        return <Text item={item} />;
      default:
        return null;
    }
  })
}
```

## Publishing your site

To deploy your website, visit our [deployment guides](/en/guides/deploy/) and follow the instructions for your preferred hosting provider.

## Publish on DatoCMS content changes

If your project is using Astro’s default static mode, you will need to set up a webhook to trigger a new build when your content changes. If you are using Netlify or Vercel as your hosting provider, you can use its webhook feature to trigger a new build when you change content in DatoCMS.

### Netlify

To set up a webhook in Netlify:

<Steps>
1. Go to your site dashboard and click on **Build & deploy**.

2. Under the **Continuous Deployment** tab, find the **Build hooks** section and click on **Add build hook**.

3. Provide a name for your webhook and select the branch you want to trigger the build on. Click on **Save** and copy the generated URL.
</Steps>

### Vercel

To set up a webhook in Vercel:

<Steps>
1. Go to your project dashboard and click on **Settings**.

2. Under the **Git** tab, find the **Deploy Hooks** section.

3. Provide a name for your webhook and the branch you want to trigger the build on. Click **Add** and copy the generated URL.
</Steps>

### Adding a webhook to DatoCMS

In your DatoCMS project admin dashboard, navigate to the **Settings** tab and click **Webhooks**. Click the plus icon to create a new webhook and give it a name. In the URL field, paste the URL generated by your preferred hosting service. As Trigger, select whichever option suits your needs. (For example: build every time a new record is published.)
