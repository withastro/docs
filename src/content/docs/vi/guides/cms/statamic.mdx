[Statamic](https://statamic.com/) is a modern, flat-file CMS. It allows developers to easily create dynamic websites and applications while offering content editors an intuitive and user-friendly interface for managing content.

## Integrating with Astro

Statamic comes with a built-in [REST API](https://statamic.dev/rest-api) and [GraphQL API](https://statamic.dev/graphql) to connect your data to Astro.

### Prerequisites

To get started, you will need to have the following:

1. REST API and GraphQL API are only available in a pro version of Statamic. You can try the Pro version free on your [local machine](https://statamic.dev/tips/how-to-enable-statamic-pro#trial-mode).
2. **An Astro project** - If you still need an Astro project, our [Installation guide](/en/install-and-setup/) will get you up and running quickly.
3. **A Statamic site** - If you need a Statamic website, [this guide](https://statamic.dev/quick-start-guide) will help you get started.
Remember to [enable REST API](https://statamic.dev/rest-api#enable-the-api) or [GraphQL API](https://statamic.dev/graphql#enable-graphql) by adding `STATAMIC_API_ENABLED=true` or `STATAMIC_GRAPHQL_ENABLED=true` in the `.env` file and enable required resources in the API configuration file.

:::caution
All the examples assume that your website has a collection called `posts`, that has a blueprint called `post`, and this blueprint has a title field (fieldtype text) and content (fieldtype markdown).
:::

### Fetching Data
:::caution
If you are using Statamic and Astro on your local machine remember to use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` when fetching the API. 

When requesting from the Astro server `localhost` doesn't resolve correctly like it does in the browser, and any fetch to either API will fail.
:::

#### REST API

Fetch your Statamic data from your site's REST API URL. By default, it's `https://[YOUR-SITE]/api/`. Then, you can render your data properties using Astro's `set:html={}` directive. 

For example, to display a list of titles and their content from a selected [collection](https://statamic.dev/collections):

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
---
const res = await fetch("https://[YOUR-SITE]/api/collections/posts/entries?sort=-date")
const posts = await res.json()
---
<h1>Astro + Statamic ðŸš€</h1>
{
  posts.map((post) => (
      <h2 set:html={post.title} />
      <p set:html={post.content} />
  ))
}
```

#### GraphQL

Fetch your Statamic data with your site's GraphQL API URL. By default, it's `https://[YOUR-SITE]/graphql/`. Then, you can render your data properties using Astro's `set:html={}` directive. 

For example, to display a list of titles and their content from a selected [collection](https://statamic.dev/collections):

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
---
const graphqlQuery = {
  query: `
    query Entries($page: Int, $locale: String) {
      entries(
        collection: "posts"
        sort: "date asc"
        limit: 20
        page: $page
        filter: { locale: $locale }
      ) {
        current_page
        has_more_pages
        data {
          title
          ... on Entry_Posts_Post {
              content
            }
        }
      }
    }
  `,
  variables: {
    page: page,
    locale: locale,
  },
};

const res = await fetch("https://[YOUR-SITE]/graphql", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify(graphqlQuery),
})

const { data } = await res.json();
const entries = data?.entries;
---
<h1>Astro + Statamic ðŸš€</h1>
{
  entries.data.map((post) => (
      <h2 set:html={post.title} />
      <p set:html={post.content} />
  ))
}
```
