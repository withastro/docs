[Builder.io](https://www.builder.io/) is a visual CMS that supports drag-and-drop content editing for building websites. 

This recipe will show you how to connect your Builder space to Astro with zero client-side JavaScript.


## Prerequisites

To get started, you will need to have the following:

* **A Builder account and space** - If you don't have an account yet, [sign up for free](https://www.builder.io/) and create a new space. If you already have a space with Builder, feel free to use it, but you will need to modify the code to match the model name (`blogpost`) and custom data fields.
* **A Builder API key** - This public key will be used to fetch your content from Builder. [Read Builder's guide on how to find your key](https://www.builder.io/c/docs/using-your-api-key#finding-your-public-api-key).

## Setting up credentials

To add your Builder API key and your Builder model name to Astro, create a `.env` file in the root of your project (if one does not already exist) and add the following variables:

```ini title=".env"
BUILDER_API_PUBLIC_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
BUILDER_BLOGPOST_MODEL='blogpost'
```

Now, you should be able to use this API key in your project.

:::note
At the time of writing, [this key is public](https://www.builder.io/c/docs/using-your-api-key#prerequisites), so you don't have to worry about hiding or encrypting it.
:::

If you would like to have IntelliSense for your environment variables, you can create a `env.d.ts` file in the `src/` directory and configure `ImportMetaEnv` like this:

```ts title="src/env.d.ts"
interface ImportMetaEnv {
  readonly BUILDER_API_PUBLIC_KEY: string;
}
```

Your project should now include these files:

<FileTree title="Project Structure">
- src/
  - **env.d.ts**
- **.env**
- astro.config.mjs
- package.json
</FileTree>


## Making a blog with Astro and Builder

### Creating a model for a blog post

The instructions below create an Astro blog using a Builder model (Type: "Section") called `blogpost` that contains two required text fields: `title` and `slug`.

:::tip[For visual types]
You can find videos showing this procedure in one of [Builder's official tutorials](https://www.builder.io/blog/creating-blog#creating-a-blog-article-model).
:::

In the Builder app create the model that will represent a blog post: go to the **Models** tab and click the **+ Create Model** button to create model with the following fields and values:

- **Type:** Section
- **Name:** "blogpost"
- **Description:** "This model is for a blog post"

In your new model use the **+ New Custom Field** button to create 2 new fields:

1. Text field
    - **Name:** "title"
    - **Required:** Yes
    - **Default value** "I forgot to give this a title"

    (leave the other parameters as their defaults)

2. Text field
    - **Name:** "slug"
    - **Required:** Yes
    - **Default value** "some-slugs-take-their-time"

    (leave the other parameters as their defaults)

Then click the **Save** button in the upper right. 

:::caution[Slugs]
There are some pitfalls with the `slug` field:

* Make sure your slug is not just a number. This seems to break the fetch request to Builder's API. 

* Make sure your slugs are unique, since your site's routing will depend on that.

### Setting up the preview

To use Builder's visual editor, create the page `src/pages/builder-preview.astro` that will render the special `<builder-component>`:

<FileTree title="Project Structure">
- src/
  - pages/
    - **builder-preview.astro**
  - env.d.ts
- .env
- astro.config.mjs
- package.json
</FileTree>

Then add the following content:

```astro title="src/pages/builder-preview.astro"
---
const builderAPIpublicKey = import.meta.env.BUILDER_API_PUBLIC_KEY;
const builderModel = import.meta.env.BUILDER_BLOGPOST_MODEL;
---

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Preview for builder.io</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>This is your header</header>

    <builder-component model={builderModel} api-key={builderAPIpublicKey}
    ></builder-component>
    <script async src="https://cdn.builder.io/js/webcomponents"></script>

    <footer>This is your footer</footer>
  </body>
</html>

```

In the above example, `<builder-component>` tells Builder where to insert the content from its CMS.

#### Setting the new route as the preview URL

<Steps>
1. Copy the full URL of your preview, including the protocol, to your clipboard (e.g. `https://{your host}/builder-preview`). 

2. Go to the **Models** tab in your Builder space, pick the model you've created and paste the URL from step 1 into the **Preview URL** field. Make sure the URL is complete and includes the protocol, for example `https://`.

3. Click the **Save** button in the upper right.
</Steps>

:::tip
When you deploy your site, change the preview URL to match your production URL, for example `https://myAwesomeAstroBlog.com/builder-preview`.
:::

#### Testing the preview URL setup

<Steps>
1. Make sure your site is live (e.g. your dev server is running) and the `/builder-preview` route is working.

2. In your Builder space under the **Content** tab, click on **New** to create a new content entry for your `blogpost` model.

3. In the Builder editor that just opened, you should be able to see the `builder-preview.astro` page with a big **Add Block** in the middle.
</Steps>

:::tip[Troubleshooting]

Things can sometimes go wrong when setting up the preview. If something's not right, you can try one of these things:

* Make sure the site is live - for example, your dev server is running.
* Make sure that the URLs match exactly - the one in your Astro project and the one set in the Builder app.
* Make sure it's the full URL including the protocol, for example `https://`.
* If you're working in a virtual environment like [IDX](https://idx.dev), [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/), or [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/), you might have to copy and paste the URL again when you restart your workspace, since this usually generates a new URL for your project.

For more ideas, read [Builder's troubleshooting guide](https://www.builder.io/c/docs/guides/preview-url-working).

### Creating a blog post

<Steps>
1. In Builder's visual editor, create a new content entry with the following values:
    - **title:** 'First post, woohoo!'
    - **slug:** 'first-post-woohoo'

2. Complete your post using the **Add Block** button and add a text field with some post content.

3. In the text field above the editor, give your entry a name. This is how it will be listed in the Builder app.

4. When you're ready click the **Publish** button in the upper right corner.

5. Create as many posts as you like, ensuring that all content entries contain a `title` and a `slug` as well as some post content.
</Steps>

### Displaying a list of blog posts

Add the following content to `src/pages/index.astro` in order to fetch and display a list of all post titles, each linking to its own page:

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" {9}
---

const builderAPIpublicKey = import.meta.env.BUILDER_API_PUBLIC_KEY;
const builderModel = import.meta.env.BUILDER_BLOGPOST_MODEL;

const { results: posts } = await fetch(
  `https://cdn.builder.io/api/v3/content/${builderModel}?${new URLSearchParams({
    apiKey: builderAPIpublicKey,
    fields: ["data.slug", "data.title"].join(","),
    cachebust: "true",
  }).toString()}`
)
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .catch();
---

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Blog Index</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <ul>
      {
        posts.flatMap(({ data: { slug, title } }) => (
          <li>
            <a href={`/posts/${slug}`}>{title}</a>
          </li>
        ))
      }
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>

```

Fetching via the content API returns an array of objects containing data for each post. The `fields` query parameter tells Builder which data is included (see highlighted code). `slug` and `title` should match the names of the custom data fields you've added to your Builder model.

The `posts` array returned from the fetch displays a list of blog post titles on the home page. The individual page routes will be created in the next step.

:::tip[Framework integrations]
If you are using a JavaScript framework (e.g. Svelte, Vue, or React) in your Astro project you can use [one of Builder's integrations](https://www.builder.io/m/integrations) as an alternative to making raw fetch calls through the REST API.
:::

Go to your index route and you should be able to see a list of links each with the title of a blog post!


### Displaying a single blog post

Create the page `src/pages/posts/[slug].astro` that will [dynamically generate a page](/en/guides/routing/#dynamic-routes) for each post.

<FileTree title="Project Structure">
- src/
  - pages/
    - index.astro
    - posts/
      - **[slug].astro**
  - env.d.ts
- .env
- astro.config.mjs
- package.json
</FileTree>

This file must contain:
- A [`getStaticPaths()`](/en/reference/routing-reference/#getstaticpaths) function to fetch `slug` information from Builder and create a static route for each blog post.
- A `fetch()` to the Builder API using the `slug` identifier to return post content and metadata (e.g. a `title`).
- A `<Fragment />` in the template to render the post content as HTML.

Each of these is highlighted in the following code snippet.  

```astro title="src/pages/posts/[slug].astro"  ins={2, 26, 33, 40, 51}
---
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const builderModel = import.meta.env.BUILDER_BLOGPOST_MODEL;
  const builderAPIpublicKey = import.meta.env.BUILDER_API_PUBLIC_KEY;
  const { results: posts } = await fetch(
    `https://cdn.builder.io/api/v3/content/${builderModel}?${new URLSearchParams(
      {
        apiKey: builderAPIpublicKey,
        fields: ["data.slug", "data.title"].join(","),
        cachebust: "true",
      }
    ).toString()}`
  )
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .catch
    // ...catch some errors...);
    ();
  return posts.map(({ data: { slug, title } }) => ({
    params: { slug },
    props: { title },
  }))
}
const { slug } = Astro.params;
const { title } = Astro.props;
const builderModel = import.meta.env.BUILDER_BLOGPOST_MODEL;
const builderAPIpublicKey = import.meta.env.BUILDER_API_PUBLIC_KEY;
// Builder's API requires this field but for this use case the url doesn't seem to matter - the API returns the same HTML
const encodedUrl = encodeURIComponent("moot");
const { html: postHTML } = await fetch(
  `https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/qwik/${builderModel}?${new URLSearchParams({
    apiKey: builderAPIpublicKey,
    url: encodedUrl,
    "query.data.slug": slug,
    cachebust: "true",
  }).toString()}`
)
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .catch();
---
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>{title}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>This is your header</header>
    <article>
      <Fragment set:html={postHTML} />
    </article>
    <footer>This is your footer</footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

:::note
The variables `builderModel` and `builderAPIpublicKey` need to be created twice, since [`getStaticPaths()` runs in its own isolated scope](/en/reference/routing-reference/#getstaticpaths).
:::

Now when you click on a link on your index route, you will be taken to the individual blog post page.

### Publishing your site

To deploy your website, visit our [deployment guides](/en/guides/deploy/) and follow the instructions for your preferred hosting provider.

#### Rebuild on Builder changes

If your project is using Astro's default static mode, you will need to set up a webhook to trigger a new build when your content changes. If you are using Netlify or Vercel as your hosting provider, you can use its webhook feature to trigger a new build whenever you click **Publish** in the Builder editor.

##### Netlify

<Steps>
1. Go to your site dashboard, then **Site Settings** and click on **Build & deploy**.

2. Under the **Continuous Deployment** tab, find the **Build hooks** section and click on **Add build hook**.

3. Provide a name for your webhook and select the branch you want to trigger the build on. Click on **Save** and copy the generated URL.
</Steps>

##### Vercel

<Steps>
1. Go to your project dashboard and click on **Settings**.

2. Under the **Git** tab, find the **Deploy Hooks** section.

3. Provide a name for your webhook and the branch you want to trigger the build on. Click **Add** and copy the generated URL.
</Steps>

##### Adding a webhook to Builder

:::tip[Official resource]
See [Builder's guide on adding webhooks](https://www.builder.io/c/docs/webhooks) for more information.
:::

<Steps>
1. In your Builder dashboard, go into your **`blogpost`** model. Under **Show More Options**, select **Edit Webhooks** at the bottom.

2. Add a new webhook by clicking on **Webhook**. Paste the URL generated by your hosting provider into the **Url** field.

3. Click on **Show Advanced** under the URL field and toggle the option to select **Disable Payload**. With the payload disabled, Builder sends a simpler POST request to your hosting provider, which can be helpful as your site grows. Click **Done** to save this selection.
</Steps>

With this webhook in place, whenever you click the **Publish** button in the Builder editor, your hosting provider rebuilds your site - and Astro fetches the newly published data for you. Nothing to do but lean back and pump out that sweet sweet content!
