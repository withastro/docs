Using a rehype plugin, you can identify and modify links in your Markdown files that point to external sites. This example adds icons to the end of each external link, so that visitors will know they are leaving your site.

## Prerequisites

- An Astro project using Markdown for content pages.

## Recipe

<Steps>
1. Install the `rehype-external-links` plugin.

    <PackageManagerTabs>
        <Fragment slot="npm">
        ```shell
        npm install rehype-external-links
        ```
        </Fragment>
        <Fragment slot="pnpm">
        ```shell
        pnpm add rehype-external-links
        ```
        </Fragment>
        <Fragment slot="yarn">
        ```shell
        yarn add rehype-external-links
        ```
        </Fragment>
      </PackageManagerTabs>

2. Import the plugin into your `astro.config.mjs` file.

	Pass `rehypeExternalLinks` to the `rehypePlugins` array, along with an options object that includes a content property. Set this property's `type` to `text` if you want to add plain text to the end of the link. To add HTML to the end of the link instead, set the property `type` to	`raw`.

    ```ts
    // ...
    import rehypeExternalLinks from 'rehype-external-links';

    export default defineConfig({
      // ...
      markdown: {
        rehypePlugins: [
          [
            rehypeExternalLinks,
            {
              content: { type: 'text', value: ' ðŸ”—' }
            }
          ],
        ]
      },
    });
    ```
  
    :::note
      The value of the `content` property is [not represented in the accessibility tree](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content#accessibility_concerns). As such, it's best to make clear that the link is external in the surrounding content, rather than relying on the icon alone.
