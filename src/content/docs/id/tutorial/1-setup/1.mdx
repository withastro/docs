## Get the dev tools you need

### Terminal

You will use a **command line (terminal)** to create your Astro project and to run key commands to build, develop, and test your site.

You can access the command line through a local terminal program for your operating system. Common applications include **Terminal** (MacOS/Linux), **Command Prompt** (Windows), and **Termux** (Android). One of these will probably already be on your machine. 

### Node.js

For Astro to run on your system, you will also need to have [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, version `v18.17.1` or `v20.3.0` or later. (`v19` is not supported.)

To check to see whether you already have a compatible version installed, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
node -v

// Example output
v18.17.1
```

If the command returns a version number higher than `v18.17.1` or `v20.3.0` (excluding any `v19`), you're good to go!

If the command returns an error message like `Command 'node' not found`, or a version number lower than the required, then you need to [install a compatible Node.js version](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

### Code Editor

Additionally, you will need to download and install a **code editor** to write your code. 

:::tip[We'll use...]
This tutorial will use **VS Code**, but you can use any editor for your operating system.
:::

<Steps>
1. [Download and install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads) or another code editor of your choice. 
</Steps>
